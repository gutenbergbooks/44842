<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The following pages are intended to present a picture
of Western China as the writer saw it in 1882, 1883,
and 1884. Chapter VII., in a somewhat modified form,
was read at a meeting of the Royal Geographical
Society on the 22nd of February, and published in the
Proceedings for June, 1886; Chapter XI. was read at
the Aberdeen meeting of the British Association in
September, 1885; and Chapter XII. was addressed to
a special meeting of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce
on the 12th of May, 1886. The remaining
Chapters are now published for the first time, and, if
they meet with half the favour bestowed upon the
Parliamentary Papers in which the journeys were first,
and somewhat roughly, described, the writer will consider
himself amply rewarded for the work which want
of leisure has compelled him to neglect so long.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.</h2>


<p>Since the publication of the first edition of this book,
in 1890, several important changes have taken place in
foreign commercial relations with Western China, and
sufficient time has now elapsed to admit of a decision
being arrived at as to how far these changes have
affected trade. The following Additional Article to the
Chefoo Agreement of 1876, which owed its existence to
the murder of Margary in the west of Yün-nan in
1875, was signed at Peking on March 31, 1890, and
the Ratifications were exchanged on January 18, 1891:</p>

<p>“The Governments of Great Britain and China,
being desirous of settling in an amicable spirit the
divergence of opinion which has arisen with respect
to the first clause of the third section of the Agreement
concluded at Chefoo in 1876, which stipulates
that&mdash;‘The British Government will be free to send
officers to reside at Ch’ung-k’ing to watch the conditions
of British trade in Szechuen [Ssŭ-ch’uan], that
British merchants will not be allowed to reside at
Ch’ung-k’ing, or to open establishments or warehouses
there, so long as no steamers have access to the port,
and that when steamers have succeeded in ascending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
the river so far, further arrangements can be taken
into consideration,’ have agreed upon the following
Additional Article:</p>

<p>“I. Ch’ung-k’ing shall forthwith be declared open
to trade on the same footing as any other Treaty
port.</p>

<p>“British subjects shall be at liberty either to
charter Chinese vessels, or to provide vessels of the
Chinese type, for the traffic between Ichang and
Ch’ung-k’ing.</p>

<p>“II. Merchandize conveyed between Ichang and
Ch’ung-k’ing by the above class of vessels shall be
placed on the same footing as merchandize carried by
steamers between Shanghae and Ichang, and shall be
dealt with in accordance with Treaty, Tariff Rules,
and the Yang-tsze Regulations.</p>

<p>“III. All Regulations as to the papers and flags to
be carried by vessels of the above description, as to the
cargo certificates with which they shall be provided,
as to the re-package of goods for the voyage beyond
Ichang, and as to the general procedure to be observed
by those engaged in the trade between Ichang and
Ch’ung-k’ing, with a view to ensuring convenience and
security, shall be drawn up by the Superintendent of
Customs at Ichang, the Taotai of the Ch’uan Tung
Circuit, who is now stationed at Ch’ung-k’ing, and the
Commissioner of Customs in consultation with the
British Consul, and shall be liable to any modifications
that may hereafter prove to be desirable and may be
agreed upon by common consent.</p>

<p>“IV. Chartered junks shall pay port dues at Ichang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
and Ch’ung-k’ing in accordance with the Yang-tsze
Regulations; vessels of Chinese type, if and when
entitled to carry the British flag, shall pay tonnage
dues in accordance with Treaty Regulations. It is
obligatory on both chartered junks and also vessels of
Chinese type, even when the latter may be entitled to
carry the British flag, to take out the Maritime
Custom-house special papers and a special flag when
intended to be employed by British subjects in the
transport of goods between Ichang and Ch’ung-k’ing,
and without such papers and flag no vessel of either
class shall be allowed the privileges and immunities
granted under this Additional Article. Provided
with special papers and flag, vessels of both classes
shall be allowed to ply between the two ports, and
they and their cargoes shall be dealt with in accordance
with Treaty Rules and the Yang-tsze Regulations.
All other vessels shall be dealt with by the Native
Customs. The special papers and flag issued by the
Maritime Customs must alone be used by the particular
vessel for which they were originally issued, and
are not transferable from one vessel to another. The
use of the British flag by vessels the property of
Chinese is strictly prohibited. Infringement of these
Regulations will, in the first instance, render the
offender liable to the penalties in force at the ports
hitherto open under Treaty; and should the offence be
subsequently repeated, the vessel’s special papers and
flag will be withdrawn, and the vessel herself refused
permission thenceforward to trade between Ichang
and Ch’ung-k’ing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>“V. When once Chinese steamers carrying cargo
run to Ch’ung-k’ing, British steamers shall in like
manner have access to the said port.</p>

<p>“VI. It is agreed that the present Additional
Article shall be considered as forming part of the
Chefoo Agreement, and as having the same force and
validity as if it were inserted therein word for word.
It shall be ratified, and the ratifications exchanged at
Peking, and it shall come into operation six months
after its signature, provided the ratifications have been
exchanged, or if they have not, then on the date at
which such exchange takes place.”</p>

<p>In other words, Ch’ung-k’ing was constituted a
Treaty port, but British steamers were denied access to
it until Chinese steamers carrying cargo should be
pleased to lead the way. No attempt to navigate west
of Ichang was ever made, nor, so far as I am aware,
was it ever contemplated by the latter, and trade
between that port and Ch’ung-k’ing has up to the
present been conducted in junks, in accordance with
the terms of this Additional Article. But it fell to
Japan, after the war of 1894-95, to claim the right of
steam navigation to Ch’ung-k’ing, and by Article VI.
of the Treaty of Peace, signed at Shimonoseki on April
17, 1895, not only was Ch’ung-k’ing opened to the
trade, residence, industries, and manufactures of
Japanese subjects, but steam navigation for vessels
under the Japanese flag for the conveyance of passengers
and cargo was extended on the Upper Yang-tsze
from Ichang to Ch’ung-k’ing.</p>

<p>By this most-favoured-nation clause, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
Ch’ung-k’ing is now open to foreign trade on the same
conditions as the other Treaty ports in China, and it
remains to be seen which country will take the initiative
in still further developing the trade of Western
China by steam. The mere opening of Ch’ung-k’ing
as a Treaty port, even without the immediate prospect
of steam communication, was undoubtedly a step in the
right direction, and the establishment there on the 1st
of April, 1891, of a British Consulate, and of an office
of the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs, soon rendered
possible a more exact estimate of the capacity of
this great trade emporium of the province of Ssŭ-ch’uan,
and of the west of China generally. In that
year, virtually from June to December, 300 junks, of a
capacity of 7,332 tons, provided with Customs Charter
Certificates and flying the Chinese flag, reported at the
Foreign Custom-house at Ch’ung-k’ing from Ichang,
with foreign goods of the value of Haikwan Taels
1,371,027, and native produce of the value of H.T.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
94,003; while 307 similarly chartered junks, of a
capacity of about 4,404 tons, left Ch’ung-k’ing for
Ichang, with exports of the value of H.T. 1,389,683,
and silver (sycee) valued at H.T. 84,381. In addition
to this, foreign goods, of the value of H.T. 2,346,055,
and H.T. 643,475, were sent, under transit pass to
Ichang and Hankow respectively, to Ssŭ-ch’uan, and
native goods of the value of H.T. 443,269 were brought
down under transit pass from that Province to Ichang
for shipment. The trade steadily increased, and in
1895 as many as 1,200 junks, whereof 878 were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
chartered by British, 112 by American, and 210 by
Chinese merchants, of a total of 36,881 tons, carried to
Ch’ung-k’ing from Ichang foreign goods valued at
H.T. 5,618,213, native goods valued at H.T. 1,238,816;
while 917 chartered junks carried away from Ch’ung-k’ing
native produce of the value of H.T. 6,396,743; a
total of imports and exports of the value of H.T.
13,253,772. Besides this, goods of the value of H.T.
662,679 were sent to Ssŭ-ch’uan, mostly to Ch’ung-k’ing,
under transit pass from Hankow and Ichang.
These figures refer only to the trade which comes under
the cognizance of the Imperial Maritime Customs, and
Mr. Woodruff, Commissioner of Customs, writing from
Ch’ung-k’ing in January, 1896, in reference to the
trade of the previous year, says&mdash;“Our petty share of
the trade (<i>i.e.</i>, the trade passing through the Foreign
Custom-house) has prospered;” and again, “With
prosperity based on such uncertain foundations, it
would be unwise to draw too definite conclusions, but
there is enough else in the appended tables to give
abundant promise: there are the possibilities of a great
trade.” The Customs Returns give precise details of
this petty share of the trade of Ssŭ-ch’uan, and an
examination of the list of exports reveals a state of
things which cannot but appear startling to those
unacquainted with the Province. In 1895, as stated
above, the value of the exports reported at the Foreign
Custom-house at Ch’ung-k’ing: was H.T. 6,396,743, and
of this amount native opium alone ranked for H.T.
2,875,180. When Ch’ung-k’ing was made an open
port, Mr. H. E. Hobson, then Commissioner of Customs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
despatched to Shanghai, for analysis, specimens of native
opium from the three Provinces of Ssŭ-ch’uan, Kuei-chow,
and Yün-nan, and, after embodying the results
of this analysis in his Report for 1891, he adds&mdash;“The
above details go to prove that of late years the native
farmers have paid closer attention to the production
of unadulterated drug, and have succeeded; whilst
there is now but little doubt that, with anything approaching
a favourable season, the out-turn of the
poppy fields of Western China alone are ample to the
ordinary requirements of pretty nearly the whole
Empire. It would be idle to attempt an estimate of
the probable total yield of what is now the favourite
spring crop of regions vaster in extent than individual
European kingdoms; but the fact is patent that, as
regards her opium supply, China is now practically
independent.” Next to native opium comes white-wax
of the value of H.T. 940,699. A description of
the remarkable industry by which this wax is produced
will be found in Chapter XI. Silk of all kinds ranks
third, with a value of H.T. 811,764; but this is a mere
fraction of the production of, and export from, the
Province, for Ssŭ-ch’uan is an immense silk district,
and the production is practically unlimited. Then
follow medicines (H.T. 589,472), musk (H.T. 540,662),
sheep’s wool (H.T. 99,377), bristles (H.T. 96,152),
hemp (H.T. 68,806), fungus (H.T. 26,202), brown
sugar (H.T. 22,973), feathers (H.T. 15,092), leather
(H.T. 13,770), safflower (H.T. 11,696), turmeric (H.T.
6,314), and some minor articles which go to make up
what is practically a petty share of the export trade of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
Ssŭ-ch’uan. Moreover, the great and most valuable
salt export from Ssŭ-ch’uan is under Government control,
and is excluded from the supervision of the Imperial
Maritime Customs. A glance at the list of imports
shows that the principal foreign goods consumed by
Ssŭ-ch’uan are&mdash;Indian cotton yarn (H.T. 2,600,637),
plain grey shirtings (H.T. 1,169,966), white shirtings
(H.T. 162,162), cotton Italians, plain and figured
(H.T. 158,803), American clarified ginseng (H.T.
131,687), cotton lastings (H.T. 128,292), woollen
lastings (H.T. 97,822), analine dyes (H.T. 86,041),
long ells (H.T. 63,648), seaweed and agar-agar (H.T.
60,917); while the principal imports of native goods
include raw cotton (H.T. 515,891), silk piece-goods
(H.T. 200,776), medicines (H.T. 92,046), cotton yarn
from Hankow (H.T. 86,329), China-root (H.T. 42,162),
paper (H.T. 28,253), paper fans (H.T. 24,519),
and cuttle-fish (H.T. 22,399). These are exclusive
of the goods, mentioned above, sent to Ssŭ-ch’uan
under transit pass from Ichang and Hankow. When
the goods have arrived at Ch’ung-k’ing they are
distributed over the Province, part going to Kuei-chow
and Yün-nan; but as transit passes are not taken out
at the port to cover their further distribution, it is
impossible to state with accuracy their ultimate destinations.
Mr. Hobson, in his Report for 1891, gives the
following reasons why inward transit passes are not
availed of. He says&mdash;“During the December quarter
documents were taken out to cover parcels of Indian
yarn to inland marts within the Szechuan borders, but,
owing to a misunderstanding at the barriers, operations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
quickly came to a conclusion.” And in the same
place, writing of outward transit, he says&mdash;“There were
no applications for passes to convey cargo from the
interior, which is not surprising when it is explained
that accumulated tax charges, <i>en route</i>, are slighter
than transit dues would amount to.” It must be borne
in mind that all these figures refer to a fraction of the
trade of Ch’ung-k’ing, and, therefore, to a much smaller
fraction of the trade of the whole Province of Ssŭ-ch’uan,
conducted between the Upper and Lower
Yang-tsze.</p>

<p>Much has been heard in recent years of the rivalry
of the French for the trade of Western China, by way
of Tonquin and the Red River (Song-koi): but we are
now in a position to test it by actual results. By Art.
II. of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Convention Additionelle de Commerce entre
la France et la Chine</span>, signed at Peking on the 26th of
June, 1887, the city of Lungchow, in the Province of
Kwangzi, and the city of Mêng-tzŭ, in Southern Yün-nan,
as well as Man-hao at the head of navigation of
the Red River, and south-west of Mêng-tzŭ, were
opened to trade, and by Art. III. the following differential
duties were, with a view to a more rapid development
of trade between China and Tonquin, agreed
upon:&mdash;Foreign goods imported into China through
these cities shall pay seven-tenths, and Chinese goods
exported to Tonquin by the same routes shall pay six-tenths,
of the general tariff in force at the Treaty ports
of China. In August, 1889, a Custom-house was
established at Mêng-tzŭ, with which I propose to deal
more particularly in this place, for the route by way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
the Red River, Man-hao, and Mêng-tzŭ is practically
the only way of access from Tonquin to Yün-nan and
the South-Western Provinces of China, and by it the
whole trade is conducted; so that the Custom-house
Returns of Mêng-tzŭ supply complete data as to its
value, volume, and distribution. The following table

<p>As the transit pass system is in full working order at
Mêng-tzŭ, it is possible to describe with accuracy the
area which this route supplies. In 1895&mdash;the latest
figures available&mdash;the value of the imports, as stated
above, was H.T. 1,809,253; and all these imports,
principally from Hong-kong, are entitled, on payment
of seven-tenths of the General Tariff import duty, and
of an additional half full import duty, to be conveyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
under transit pass to any destination in the interior
without further taxation. Eighty-four per cent. were
so carried, of the value of H.T. 1,521,021, and of this the
Province of Yün-nan itself consumed H.T. 1,509,491,
leaving a balance of H.T. 11,530 for distribution in
other Provinces. Of this latter, Ta-ting Fu, in Kuei-chow,
took seven piculs of prepared tobacco, of the
value of H.T. 210; Chang-sha and Ch’ang-tê Hupeh,
on the opposite bank of the Yang-tsze from Hankow,
took 41 catties of cassia lignea, of the value of H.T. 14.
There still remains goods of the value of H.T. 10,936
to be accounted for. These were sent to three places
in the Province of Ssŭ-ch’uan, namely, Ning-yüan Fu,
which is situated in that part of the Province which
juts into the north of Yün-nan, and is separated from
the highest navigable point on the Yang-tsze by the
inaccessible Lolo country. I visited this city on March
20, 1883, by the only available mountain road from
Ch’êng-tu, the capital of Ssŭ-ch’uan, and it is not at all
surprising, when the difficulties of this route are taken
into account, that it draws its supplies from Mêng-tzŭ.
Its requirements, however, amounted to the small sum
of H.T. 10,085, consisting almost entirely of Indian
cotton yarn. The other two places in Ssŭ-ch’uan
which drew from Mêng-tzŭ were Ch’êng-tu, which took
25 catties of cinnamon, valued at H.T. 800, and Hsü-chou
Fu, at the junction of the Chin-sha Chiang (Upper
Yang-tsze) and the Min River, whose requirements
consisted of 203 catties of inferior cardamoms, of the
value of H.T. 51. While Ning-yüan will in all probability
continue to satisfy its wants from Mêng-tzŭ,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
there is not the remotest likelihood of other parts of
Ssŭ-ch’uan deserting the Yang-tsze route and Ch’ung-k’ing.
Although Kuei-chow drew seven piculs of
prepared tobacco, and Chao-t’ung, the northern prefecture
of Yün-nan, took four pieces of T cloths and 14&frac12;
piculs of tobacco from Mêng-tzŭ, I see no reason to
alter what I wrote eight years ago in the concluding
paragraph of Chapter XII. “The only route to Ssŭ-ch’uan,
Kuei-chow, and Northern Yün-nan is the Yang-tsze,
on whose upper waters a large trade in foreign
goods is even now conducted, a trade which is capable
of enormous development when the present burdensome
taxation is reduced. The opening of Ch’ung-k’ing
by the ascent of a steamer&mdash;an event anxiously
looked forward to by the native merchants of Ssŭ-ch’uan,
will, as I have pointed out, reduce that taxation,
and will enable millions, who at present look
upon foreign goods as articles of luxury, to become
themselves consumers; and I trust the day is not far
distant when the British flag will float over entrepôts
of British manufactures throughout Western China.”
The unwieldy junk, which, if it succeeds in covering
the distance of 400 miles between Ichang and Ch’ung-k’ing
in less than a month, is considered to have made
a good passage, is still the only means of communication
between the Lower Yang-tsze and Ssŭ-ch’uan.
This long passage entails heavy freights, thereby
enhancing the retail prices and hindering the free distribution
of our manufactures; and it is sincerely to be
hoped that the permission granted by the Japanese
Treaty of Shimonoseki, to employ steam on the Upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
Yang-tsze, will soon bear fruit. The French have succeeded
in running small steamers on the Red River
from Hanoi to Lao-kai, that is, to the frontier of Yün-nan,
and a weekly service is maintained between Yen-bai
and Lao-kai; but in winter the river is too shallow
to admit of the passage of even small steamers. In
1895 a cargo steamer was placed on the line in summer,
for junk navigation, owing to the strong current, virtually
ceases from the beginning of May until September;
but the Chinese, even although freights were as
light as by junk, refused to ship by her on the plea that
“the arrival of goods could not be regulated as at
present, and that prices would consequently fall.”
The long journey overland from Mêng-tzŭ, or rather
Man-hao, to Ssŭ-ch’uan, Kuei-chow, and Northern Yün-nan,
is, in my opinion, an insuperable barrier to a
successful rivalry of the Red River with the Yang-tsze.</p>

<p>On the 1st of March, 1894, a Convention between
Great Britain and China, relative to the boundaries of,
and overland trade between, Burmah and China, was
signed at London. Art. VIII. of that Convention
says&mdash;“Subject to the conditions mentioned hereafter
in Articles X. and XI., the British Government, wishing
to encourage and develop the land trade of China
with Burmah as much as possible, consent, for a
period of six years from the ratification of the present
Convention, to allow Chinese produce and manufactures,
with the exception of salt, to enter Burmah by
land duty free, and to allow British manufactures and
Burmese produce, with the exception of rice, to be
exported to China by land free of duty. The duties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
on salt and rice imported and exported shall not be
higher than those imposed on their import or export
by sea.” Art. XI. says&mdash;“The exportation from
Burmah into China of salt is prohibited,” and “the
exportation from China into Burmah of cash, rice,
pulse, and grains of every kind is prohibited;” and,
again, “The importation and exportation across the
frontier of opium and spirituous liquors is prohibited,
excepting in small quantities for the personal
use of travellers.” Art. XI. says&mdash;“Pending
the negotiation of a more complete arrangement, and
until the development of the trade shall justify the
establishment of other frontier Customs stations, goods
imported from Burmah into China, or exported from
China into Burmah shall be permitted to cross the
frontier by Manwyne and by Sansi. With a view to
the development of trade between China and Burmah,
the Chinese Government consent that for six years
from the ratification of the present Convention the
duties levied on goods imported into China by these
routes shall be those specified in the General Tariff of
the Maritime Customs, diminished by three-tenths,
and that the duties on goods exported from China by
the same route shall be those specified in the same
tariff, diminished by four-tenths. Transit passes for
imports and exports shall be granted in accordance
with the rules in force at the Treaty ports.” Art.
XIII. says&mdash;“It is agreed that His Majesty the
Emperor of China may appoint a Consul in Burmah,
to reside at Rangoon; and that Her Britannic Majesty
may appoint a Consul to reside at Manwyne.” By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
this Convention, therefore, the same differential duties
have been fixed as in the trade between Tonquin and
China; but it will be observed that while Yün-nan
pays for a considerable part of its imports by the Red
River with native opium, it is debarred from exporting
it to Burmah. What progress trade is making across
the Burmah-Yün-nan frontier under these conditions I
am not in a position to say, for I have seen no recent
statistics bearing on the subject; but it labours under
the same disadvantages in regard to its area of supply
as the Red River route. The overland transit is too
long, and therefore too expensive, to admit of the
richest parts of Western China being “tapped” by it.</p>

<p>On the 1st of December, 1888, a Convention between
France and China was signed at Chefoo, whereby,
<i>inter alia</i>, the junction of the Chinese and French telegraph
lines in Yün-nan and Tonquin respectively was
agreed to, and Mêng-tzŭ and Lao-kai, which lies just
within the Tonquin frontier, were subsequently united
by wire; and on the 6th September, 1894, a similar
Convention, respecting the junction of the Chinese
and Burmese telegraph lines, was signed at Tien-tsin
between Great Britain and China, wherein it was
stipulated that the junction should be effected between
the British station at Bhamo and the Chinese station
at Têng-yüeh (Momein), at latest on the 31st May,
1895, unless prevented by accident or by <i>force majeure</i>.</p>

<p>By a Supplementary Convention, concluded between
France and China at Peking on the 20th of June,
1895, and ratified in 1896, Man-hao, the station
opened by Art. II. of the Convention of 1887, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
the head of navigation of the Red River in Yün-nan,
is superseded by Ho-k’ou, a place on the left bank of
the same river, and just within the Chinese frontier.</p>

<p>Of recent years Western China has acted as a
magnet, not only to exploring expeditions, but also to
more practical commercial missions. In 1890 a French
expedition, including Prince Henry of Orleans, passed
southwards through Western Ssŭ-ch’uan and Yün-nan
by way of Ta-li Fu, Mêng-tsŭ, and the Red River, from
Tibet to Tonquin; and in 1895 the Prince was again
at Ta-li Fu, whence he proceeded west to the Mekong,
ascended the right bank of the latter to Tse-ku, and
then struck westwards across the Salwen and Irrawady
to Sadiya in Assam. To show the spirit of
rivalry which exists, I may quote from the paper which
the Prince read before the Royal Geographical Society
on the 18th of May, 1896, and published in the December
number of the <i>Geographical Journal</i> of that year.
He says&mdash;“We heard [at Ssŭ-mao] that two Englishmen
had just left the town. This news was not
calculated to rejoice our hearts. Reconnoitring
parties are numerous in Yün-nan, and there is a race
between the French and English, and even amongst
the French themselves. The field of the unknown is
day by day being reduced with marvellous rapidity,
and to find unexplored ground on the map one must
hasten. At Ta-li Fu we were told that one of these
Englishmen was Captain Davis, who arrived from
Burmah by way of T’êng-yüeh and Ta-li, intending to
return by Mien-ning, Ssŭ-mao, P’u-êrh Fu, and
Tamano. We twice crossed the itinerary of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
travellers, and were lucky enough only to travel along
120 miles of the same road.”</p>

<p>A French commercial mission (Mission Lyonnaise
d’Exploration Commerciale en Chine), consisting of a
dozen members, and including several experts, has
recently overrun Western China from Tonquin to the
borders of Tibet, part of the mission remaining at
Ch’ung-k’ing for some considerable time. A Japanese
Commercial Mission visited Ch’ung-k’ing in December,
1895, and returned in January, 1896, and the United
States Mission, which left Tien-tsin overland for Chêng-tu
to arrange a settlement, so far as American missionaries
were concerned, of the anti-missionary outrages
which occurred there and in other parts of the
Province of Ssŭ-ch’uan in May and June, 1895,
returned by way of Ch’ung-k’ing and the Yang-tsze in
January, 1896. At the present moment the Blackburn
Commercial Mission, headed by Mr. Bourne, of the
British Consular Service in China, my successor as
Consular Agent at Ch’ung-k’ing in 1884, is traversing
the Western Provinces of China; and it is certain that
all these missions have collected, and are collecting,
information which cannot fail to be of great assistance
in developing foreign trade with the West of China.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of China, from a geographical
and ethnological point of view, is the West&mdash;geographically,
because its recesses have not yet been
thoroughly explored, and ethnologically, because a great
part of it is peopled by races which are non-Chinese,
and one at least of which, though nominally owing
allegiance to the Great Khan, is in reality independent.
It was my fortune to be stationed in Western China
from 1882 to 1884, and, during these three years, I was
enabled, in the performance of my duties, to collect
information regarding the country and its people; and
it is in the hope that this information may not be un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>acceptable
that I venture to lay the following pages
before the public.</p>

<p>Reports of the journeys which I made in Western
China during the above years have already appeared
in the shape of Parliamentary Papers<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>; but, written as
they were without any idea of publication and intended
as mere trade notes, strung together from day
to day on the march, they are not sufficiently connected
to present a fair picture of this remote region.</p>

<p>That part of Western China, with which I am
personally acquainted and with which I propose to
deal, lies to the south, and embraces the provinces of
Ssŭ-ch’uan, Kuei-chow and Yün-nan, which, interesting
in themselves, have become of considerable importance
since the extension of the Indian Empire to the
frontier of China and the absorption of Tonquin by the
French.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE WAY THITHER.</i></div>

<p>The great highway to the West is the River Yang-tsze.
By the Agreement of Chefoo of September, 1876,
the port of Ichang, situated on the north bank of the
Yang-tsze about a thousand miles from the sea, was
opened to foreign trade and foreign steam navigation;
and, by the same Agreement, the residence of a Consular
Officer at the city of Ch’ung-k’ing, in Ssŭ-ch’uan,
to watch the conditions of British trade, was provided
for. It was to take up this post that I left Wuhu
towards the end of October, 1881. On arrival at
Hankow, I discovered that the steamer, which had for
some years been employed to run to Ichang, was undergoing
extensive repairs at Shanghai, to better fit her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
for the navigation of the Upper Yang-tsze, and that
another and larger steamer belonging to the same
Company had just returned from Ichang with little
hope, owing to the sudden fall of the river, of being
then able to make another trip. A large quantity of
cargo, however, which had accumulated at Hankow,
induced the Company, much against the captain’s will,
to send the steamer forward again; but, drawing only
nine feet, she was unable, after a day’s journey, to push
her way through six feet of sand and water, and had to
return. After about a month’s delay, the smaller
steamer arrived at Hankow, and, laden to six feet,
reached Ichang with considerable difficulty on the 17th
of December, the trip having occupied eight days. On
this section of the river, navigation commences at
daybreak, and, unless there is good moonlight, ceases
at dark. Owing to the shifting sands, which constitute
the bed of the river, the channel is constantly
changing, and it is not uncommon to find the passage,
which the steamer took on the up passage, completely
barred on the down trip. The consequence is that
soundings have constantly to be taken, and delay is
the result. This refers to the winter months only,
when the river is low, as, during high water, little
difficulty exists, and the distance has been covered in
fifty hours.</p>

<p>The selection of Ichang as an open port has frequently
been called in question, and it has been pointed
out that Sha-shih, a town farther down the river and
one of the six calling stations for steamers, would have
been a preferable choice. Much may be said for Sha-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>shih,
which is the principal terminus of the junk traffic
between Ssŭ-ch’uan and the eastern provinces of China,
but statistics clearly prove that Ichang has after all
been a success. Although it is neither a producing nor
a consuming district of any importance itself, the net
value of the trade which has gravitated towards it has
risen from £18,000 in 1878 to over £1,000,000 in 1888.
This, it should be remembered, represents the trade in
vessels of foreign build only.</p>

<p>After a few days bargaining at Ichang&mdash;passage by
steamer being no longer available&mdash;I succeeded in
hiring a native passenger-boat to convey myself, servants,
and baggage the four hundred miles that still lay
between me and my destination for the exorbitant
sum of one hundred and eighty taels, or forty-five
pounds. A larger sum was at first demanded, and,
there being only two or three boats of this class in
port, whose owners combined to “squeeze” me, I
was ultimately obliged to pay about a third more than
the customary price. Travelling boats on the Upper
Yang-tsze are, as a rule, very roomy and comfortable.
They can usually be divided off into as many as four or
five small rooms by wooden partitions; and, travelling
as I was in winter, I had a stove fitted up, regulating
the temperature by the windows which run along the
sides of what is really an oblong house placed on the
boat’s deck. In a good boat, the roof is over six feet
in height, so that one can walk about comfortably from
end to end. A mast is shipped right in front of and
against the deckhouse, and this is utilized both for
sailing and tracking&mdash;the tracking line running through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
a noose fixed near the top. In front of the mast is a
broad deck, contracting towards the bows, accommodating
from ten to a dozen rowers, and convertible at
night into sleeping quarters for the crew. Over a well
in the bows, and attachable to the deck by a noose,
hangs a long heavy spar by which the boat can be
speedily steered in any required direction&mdash;an absolute
necessity where, tracking being carried on, sunken
rocks close in-shore have to be avoided, or the tracking
line gives way in a strong current.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SKIPPER AND CREW.</i></div>

<p>In the agreement entered into between the skipper
of the boat and myself, it was stipulated that there
should be seven of a crew and fifteen trackers. The
crew consisted of the skipper, the bowsman or pilot, who
stood at the bows all day long and sounded continually
with a long iron-shod bamboo, the steersman, three
deck hands, and the cook, who exercised his culinary
art in a primitive kitchen constructed in an opening in
the deck near the bows.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AN AMUSING EPISODE.</i></div>

<p>The skipper, being a confirmed opium-smoker, proved
of little use; and it was not until the second night from
Ichang that I discovered his smoking propensities. I
lay with my head towards the bows and, being awakened
during the night by someone crying, I saw a light shining
through the chinks of the partitions. On calling
my servant to see what was the matter, I learned that
the light was the light of an opium lamp, and that the
wife of the skipper was crying because her husband
would not come to bed. I got up and found him lying
at full length alongside his lamp. I bundled him into
the little room which he, his wife, and two children
occupied over the stern, and blew out his lamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>After this episode, the smoking was never carried
on in any place likely to attract my attention, although
the sickening odour frequently penetrated to my rooms
from deck and stern, several of the crew being also addicted
to the drug. I had repeated conversations with
the skipper as to the craving he had contracted; and,
one morning, I overtook him on shore walking rapidly
and in rather an excited state. I asked him what was
the matter, and he replied that the weather was so cold
that it was necessary to lay in a supply of coal at once,
and that in order not to delay the boat, he was hurrying
to the next village to make the purchase. I left
him there and continued my walk.</p>

<p>On boarding the boat above the village, I asked my
servant where the coals had been stowed, when, to my
surprise, he told me that no coals had come aboard, but
that the skipper had laid in a fresh supply of opium,
that his stock had been exhausted over night, and that
he had been dying all morning for a smoke! He fought
shy of me for several days after this, knowing that his
tampering with the truth had been discovered. Smoking
had reduced him to such a state that he had really
no command over the boat or crew; when an accident
happened&mdash;an event of common occurrence&mdash;he used to
crawl on to the top of the deckhouse and find fault in
a querulous voice, which was quickly suppressed by the
bowsman telling him to mind his own business. When
high words ensued, the cook, in addition to his own
special functions, assumed the part of mediator, and
used to groan and plead for silence after each explosion.
When the trackers were on shore and the other hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
were all busy on deck, it likewise devolved on the cook
to jump from his lair and signal the trackers, who were
nearly always out of calling distance, by beating the
small drum which lay at the foot of the mast. The
bickerings between the skipper and his crew sometimes
reached a climax. On one occasion, after dancing an
angry jig on the roof of the deckhouse to a stormy
vocal accompaniment, he scrambled on deck and was
proceeding on shore to continue his harangue from <i>terra
firma</i>, when the plank gave way and he disappeared
amid the boisterous laughter of the crew, quickly reappearing
like a drowned rat, and thoroughly cooled
for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>The trackers, too, deserve a word of mention.
They were, with the exception of the musician and the
diver, almost all lithe young fellows, always willing to
jump on shore, never spending more than a quarter of
an hour over their rice and vegetables, and never out
of temper. The musician and the diver were somewhat
aged. When there was no tracking ground, and the
oars had to be called into requisition, the former used
to sing his boat songs, the whole crew joining loudly
in the choruses, the echoes reverberating from cliff to
cliff in the gorges. If the tracking line got entangled
among the rocks off the shore, the diver would doff
everything, slip overboard, and swim to the rescue. I
pitied this individual very much; he used to scramble
on board chattering with cold, and had no sooner got
warm than his services were again in demand. The
boat was always moored before dark, and, until supper
was ready, the crew were busy rigging up the roof-mats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to form their night quarters. Then the beds with their
coir mattresses were produced from under the deck;
and, with the exception of two or three opium-smokers,
these hard-working fellows dropped off into well-earned
sleep until daybreak, when the same round of toil
awaited them.</p>

<p>Such was the boat and crew with which I ascended
from Ichang into Western China, reaching Ch’ung-k’ing
on the 24th of January, 1882, after a passage of
a month. It is unnecessary for me to describe this
journey in detail. Blakiston, Gill, Little, and others
have given their experiences; they have painted living
pictures of the grand, majestic gorges; they have
brought the world within earshot of the hissing, seething
rapids; and it only remains for me to say a few
words on a subject which has of late years received no
little attention&mdash;the navigability of the Upper Yang-tsze
by steamers. The question is about to be put to
the test in accordance with clauses in the Agreement of
Chefoo, which state that “British merchants will not
be allowed to reside at Ch’ung-k’ing, or to open establishments
or warehouses there, so long as no steamers
have access to the port. When steamers have succeeded
in ascending the river so far, further arrangements
can be taken into consideration.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NAVIGABILITY OF THE YANG-TSZE.</i></div>

<p>Ever since I ascended the Upper Yang-tsze, I have
not ceased, both in China and England, to advocate the
advisability, from a commercial point of view, of steamers
attempting the navigation of these waters. Difficulties
have been pointed out, but I have endeavoured
to show that these have been greatly exaggerated; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the “Upper Yang-tsze Steam Navigation Company,”
lately formed, would appear to be of like mind. The
obstacles that exist lie between Ichang and the Ssŭ-ch’uan
frontier, a distance of about one hundred miles:
beyond the frontier, all is plain sailing, not only as far
as Ch’ung-k’ing but even to Hsü-chou Fu, some two
hundred miles further west. They consist of a series
of rapids, which prove very trying to native craft when
the river is low, that is, from the middle of November
to the middle of March or a little later&mdash;the very time
when junks are best able to ascend; as, during the rest
of the year, the increased volume of water, although
obliterating the rapids altogether, flows with a strong
current, which renders tracking very difficult and frequently
impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CH’ING T’AN RAPID.</i></div>

<p>The season, then, that proves all but impossible for
junks is the very season when steamers could run, and
<i>vice versâ</i>. During low water, there is, in my opinion,
one, and only one, insuperable obstacle to a steamer&mdash;the
Ch’ing T’an Rapid, the first serious rapid above
Ichang. It lies at the eastern entrance of the Mi-tsang
or “Granary” Gorge. When I passed down in the end
of December, 1884, there were three channels in the
rapid&mdash;the chief or central channel never attempted by
ascending junks, and two side channels separated from
the central by masses of rock. The central was the
only channel available for a steamer, but it consisted of
a clear fall of from six to eight feet. The side channels
were narrow, with a very much less volume of water
and fall. In ascending these, junks could be dragged
over close to the rocks, which would be impossible in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
case of a steamer. In the gorge itself, the current was
very sluggish, and boats were passing and re-passing
just above the rapid. I stood a hundred yards to the
west of it, and saw junks disappearing one after the
other. As their masts are always unshipped in the
down passage, they seemed to me to be passing with
their human freight into eternity. The strange sight
insensibly drew me to the rapid itself, and I stood facing
it to watch the movements of my own boat. It was
pulled out into mid-stream, and allowed to float stern
down until about to enter the rapid, when it was gently
wheeled round and drawn into the fall. It is difficult
to describe what happened next: a sudden plunge, considerable
confusion on board, the junk herself floating
helplessly stern down stream, the skipper on the roof
of the deck-house frantically waving his arms, one of
the three lifeboats, which are always stationed below
the rapid, approaching the boat and then rescuing the
crew, the deserted junk making for the scattered rocks
which jut out from the right bank at the second rapid
two hundred yards below the fall, its safe passage
through the rocks and rapid, its salvage by our accompanying
gunboat, all presented a picture which will
never be effaced from my memory. The cause of the
accident was thus described to me. In shooting the
rapid, several of the crew lost their heads and their
oars, and the others, unable to keep the bows down
river or to control the boat, and being afraid that she
would be dashed against the rocks at the second rapid,
called for the lifeboat and abandoned her. Such accidents
are of frequent occurrence, and are very often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
accompanied with damage, wreck, and loss of life.
We were lucky in being able to continue our journey
after a couple of hours’ delay.</p>

<p>I have described the descent of the Ch’ing T’an
Rapid in this place, in order to show the different phases
which it presents at the same season in different years,
for when I ascended it on almost the same day (December
29th) in 1881, not a rock was visible above water,
and we had little difficulty, with the aid of some fifty
additional trackers, in being dragged over it. Were
this rapid a race, as it is not, I should have more hesitation
in describing it as insuperable for a steamer during
low water; but I consider it extremely doubtful whether
the slow fall would be sufficiently powerful to raise a
steamer’s bows off the sunken rocks. It has been said
that, if the Upper Yang-tsze were navigated by steam,
collisions would be of frequent occurrence, but not more
so than in the section between Hankow and Ichang.
In ascending, junks are tracked as close to the banks
as possible, while in descending, they keep to the middle
of the river. In fact, collisions should be of rare occurrence.
West of the Ch’ing T’an Rapid, there is nothing
to interfere with the ascent of a steamer for more than
five hundred miles.</p>

<p>It was during my daily rambles along the banks of
the river, that I first made acquaintance with the poppy
of commerce. Before entering the province of Ssŭ-ch’uan,
I spoke to the boatmen, and asked them to tell
me as soon as they saw the plant growing; and from
Wan Hsien westwards to Ch’ung-k’ing there was one
continuous yell of <i>Ya-pien-yen</i>, which means the opium!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
It shared the banks of the river with wheat, peas,
and beans. The spikelets were from four to five inches
above ground, and little did I think, when I looked at
these tiny plants, that it would be my lot at no distant
date to wander through hundreds of miles of beautiful
poppy flowers. On arrival at the district city of
Yün-yang, I visited the picturesque temple that peeps
through the dense foliage which clings to the steep
sides of the hill forming the right bank of the river;
and, in course of conversation with the head priest, I
remarked that there seemed to be less poppy here than
farther east. Raising his hand and pointing to the
opposite hills, he replied, “There is nothing but poppy
beyond.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CITY OF CH’UNG-K’ING.</i></div>

<p>The city of Ch’ung-k’ing, in lat. 29° 33′ 50″ N. and
long. 107° 2′ E., occupies the apex of the peninsula caused
by the attempt of the Yang-tsze on its north bank to
pierce the sandstone cliffs under the little walled town
of Fu-t’ou-Kuan, and join its turbid waters with the
clear flow of the Chia-ling Chiang some four miles from
the actual junction of the two rivers. It is built on a
slope which extends from hill-tops overlooking the Chia-ling
to the bed of the Yang-tsze. Outside the walls
there are no suburbs of any importance. A bird’s-eye
view from the opposite hills shows that there is scarcely
a patch of ground which is not built upon. One or two
plots of vegetables inside the north-west corner of the
wall, and a few trees here and there, are the only exceptions
to the grey mass of buildings clinging firmly
to the hill-side. It contains a population estimated at
some 200,000 souls, and may be described as the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>mercial
metropolis of Western China. This was the
spot chosen for the residence of a Consular Officer, to
watch the conditions of British trade in Ssŭ-ch’uan;
and it was here that I took up residence in January,
1882. I do not intend to weary my readers with trade
statistics; those who are interested in commerce will
find some of the results of my enquiries and observations
in a subsequent chapter specially devoted to that
subject. What I propose to do is to carry them with
me in my wanderings through Western China, with
Ch’ung-k’ing as a base, and endeavour to show them
the country and its people as they appeared to my eyes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MY OVERLAND CARAVAN.</i></div>

<p>Having acquainted myself with my surroundings,
perused the records left by my predecessors, and gained
an insight into the duties expected of me, I resolved to
make a journey into the provinces of Kuei-chow and
Yün-nan. To this end, I obtained a general passport
from the Viceroy of Ssŭ-ch’uan, and a special passport
from the authorities of Ch’ung-k’ing covering the
ground to be traversed, and proceeded to make arrangements
for the trip. As the greater part of the journey
was to be made overland, it was necessary to organize
a caravan of chair-bearers and porters. However willing
one may be to walk, Chinese etiquette demands, in
a civil official, the presence of a sedan; and, in visiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the native authorities&mdash;a part of my programme&mdash;a
chair is a <i>sine quâ non</i>. Ch’ung-k’ing being well supplied
with chair <i>hongs</i> or establishments, I had no difficulty
in collecting about a score of coolies to accompany me
to Yün-nan and back. This included a headman, whose
duty it was to maintain order, and supply the places of
those who, from sickness or other causes, might fall out
on the march. The terms were three hundred large
copper cash per man per day, two hundred to be paid
while travelling, the balance to be handed over on our
return to Ch’ung-k’ing. On resting days, a sum of only
one hundred large cash was payable. A contract to
this effect was duly drawn up and signed, and it only
remained to adjust the loads and assign the men their
respective places.</p>

<p>Cash being the only currency in China, I had to
take with me a large supply of silver ingots, each of the
value of about ten taels or Chinese ounces, which had
to be sliced, weighed, and exchanged <i>en route</i>. This is
one of the many annoyances of Chinese travel, as each
place has its own weights and its own exchange. For
example, when I left Ch’ung-k’ing a tael was worth
1,480 large cash; further south it was equivalent to
only 1,200, while on one occasion in Yün-nan it rose
to 1,580 cash. The risk of carrying silver could not,
however, be avoided, for it would have required the
services of all my men at starting to lift the equivalent
in cash of the silver necessary to pay their wages for
the journey, not including the balance to be handed
over to them on our return.</p>

<p>Rice and vegetables, supplemented occasionally by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
little fish, or pork and sauce, constitute the daily food
of the Chinese; but they do not commend themselves
to the European palate. To ensure a fair measure of
comfort, therefore, I took with me some tinned provisions,
to be broached as necessity demanded.</p>

<p>April the 19th was the day fixed for our departure,
and at daylight we groped our way through the mist
which, in Spring, hangs continually over the city, and
descended to the Great River&mdash;the local name of the
Yang-tsze&mdash;across which we were ferried in a couple of
large flat-bottomed boats. The river at this point is
about eight hundred yards in breadth, and flows with
a current of from four to five knots. The most conspicuous
objects on the south or right bank, which
consists of a range of hills from seven to eight hundred
feet in height, are the temple of Lao-chün Tung,
nestling amidst a grove of trees, and Blakiston’s “Pinnacle
Pagoda,” crowning the highest peak of the range.
The high-road to Kuei-chow winds up the bank between
them, and, after a slight descent, enters a limestone
valley beyond. The bank itself is composed of coal and
lime, both of which were being quarried for use in
Ch’ung-k’ing.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HARVESTING OPIUM.</i></div>

<p>In this valley, which extends for miles, I first made
acquaintance with the poppy in full bloom. Fields of
white and purple equalled in number the patches of
wheat, barley, and rape. Where the flowers had fallen,
the peasants, principally women and children, were
busy harvesting the juice. The tools used in the operation
are simple but effective. Towards evening, the
peasants may be seen moving in the poppy fields, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
armed with a short wooden handle, from one of the ends
of which protrude three and sometimes four points of
brass or copper blades, firmly inserted in the wood.
Seizing a capsule with the left hand, the operator, with
his right hand, inserts the points of the blades near the
top of the capsule, and draws them downwards to the
stem of the plant. From the incisions thus made a
creamy juice exudes, which gradually becomes of a dark
brown colour. This is scraped off in the early morning
by means of a short curved knife, and deposited in an
earthenware bowl, the contents of which are afterwards
fired or left in the sun to dry. In this way, the weight
is reduced about one half, and the opium is then ready
for boiling. The whole process is simple, and may be
accomplished by the women and children of the family,
thereby permitting the more able-bodied to attend to
the other farm duties, thus reducing the price of labour
and consequently the cost of the drug. The bleeding
of the capsule is continued until the flow of juice is
exhausted.</p>

<p>The remainder of the valley was occupied by rice
fields, submerged in preparation for the summer sowing.
Sometimes they are allowed to soak for months, their
surfaces being frequently covered with floating water-plants,
which are afterwards utilized as manure. They
are likewise stocked with fish; in the early spring, reeds
and rank grass are cut from the hill sides and made up
into small bundles, which are then strung on bamboos,
laid down in shallow water in the Yang-tsze, and
weighted with stones. Here the fish spawn, and the
ova adhere to the grass and reeds, which are then taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
up and sold. The grass is afterwards scattered in the
higher fields, between which and the lower, water-communication
is kept up by digging small outlets, which
can easily be filled up at a moment’s notice. Here the
ova are hatched, and good fishing may be had after a
few months.</p>

<p>The <i>modus operandi</i> deserves a short description.
Neither line nor hook is used, the requisite gear consisting
of a long bamboo and a round wicker basket,
open at the bottom with a hole at the top. The fisherman
wades into the field, the water usually reaching to
the knee; grasping the bamboo in his right, he sweeps
the surface of the water in front of him with a semicircular
motion until a silver streak and a dash into the
mud meet his eye, when he plunges forward and caps
the spot with the basket which he has been carrying in
his left hand. He then gropes for his prey through the
basket, and is, I may say, rarely at fault. The fish&mdash;some
six inches long&mdash;is then tossed over the shoulder
into a smaller basket strapped to the back, and the
farmer recommences his field-fishing.</p>

<p>The wood-oil tree&mdash;<i>Aleurites cordata, M. Arg.</i>&mdash;was
scattered about among the fields. It seems to
prefer thin-soiled, rocky ground, being met with in
great abundance on the banks of the Yang-tsze west of
Ichang. It grows to a height of about fifteen feet, and
has large, beautiful, shady green leaves, which were
lighted up as we passed with bunches of small pink-white
flowers. It produces a large green fruit like an
apple, the large pips or seeds of which contain the oil
for which the tree is famous. The fruit is gathered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
August and September. Primitive wooden presses with
wedges are used for extracting the oil, which is sent to
market in wooden tubs with tight-fitting lids, and is
employed for a variety of purposes, such as the manufacture
of paint, varnish, waterproof paper, umbrellas, as
well as for lighting. The seeds, if eaten, cause nausea
and vomiting.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.</i></div>

<p>Between Ch’ung-k’ing and Ch’i-chiang Hsien, the
first city of any importance on the southern road to
Kuei-chow, there are a number of factories for the manufacture
of the ordinary coarse Chinese paper. Here,
too, the process is exceedingly simple. There is an
entire absence of machinery for washing and shredding
rags; there are no troughs of pulp, chemicals for bleaching,
resin for watering, wire moulds for receiving, and
drums for firming the paper as it comes from the pulp-troughs.
Bamboo stems and paddy straw are steeped
with lime in deep concrete pits in the open air, and
allowed to soak for months. When nothing but the
fibre remains, it is taken out and rolled with a heavy
stone roller in a stone well until all the lime has been
removed. A small quantity of the fibre is placed in a
stone trough full of water and the whole stirred up. A
close bamboo mould is then passed through the mixed
fibre and water, and the film which adheres to it emerges
as a sheet of paper, which is stuck up to dry on the
walls of a room kept at a high temperature. The sheets
are afterwards collected and made up into bundles for
market.</p>

<p>Ch’i-chiang Hsien is a city somewhat irregularly built
along the foot and on the slope of a hill which rises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
from the left bank of a river, a tributary of the Yang-tsze
and bearing the city’s name. It is of very considerable
importance as a trade depôt for north-eastern Kuei-chow,
and, being in water communication with the
Yang-tsze, it is a valuable inlet for the Ssŭ-ch’uan salt
trade with that province. Kuei-chow, unlike Ssŭ-ch’uan
and Yün-nan, is unprovided with salt wells within
its borders, at least they have not yet been discovered,
and the Lu Chou junks have their terminus at Ch’i-chiang,
whence the mineral is distributed on the backs
of bipeds.</p>

<p>This latter was to me a painful sight. Men and boys
(children, I should rather say, many of them being not
more than eight years of age) staggered on with enormous
loads of cake salt packed in small creels and on
wooden frameworks projecting above them. Walking
in Indian file along the pathway that served as a road,
they halted every few yards, resting their loads on a
crutch which each carried in his hand, and, uttering
that half whistle, half sigh, which proclaims the body’s
utter weariness and its gratitude for a moment’s relief,
scraped from their brows and faces, by a ring of split
bamboo attached to the load by a string, the sweat
that literally gushed from them. Of a surety they
earn their bread by the sweat of their brow!</p>

<p>One expecting to find amongst such men a splendid
development of muscle would be sadly disappointed.
Like the brick-tea carriers on their way to Tibet, of
whom I shall have occasion to speak hereafter, they
were painfully wanting in leg. Yet the maximum load
is about two hundred and forty pounds. For carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the salt the distance of one hundred miles between Ch’i-chiang
and T’ung-tzŭ, the first district city across the
Kuei-chow border, they were paid at the rate of ten
cash a catty, or one and a third pounds. As the journey
occupied them ten days, and the return, empty-handed
except for their wages in cash, two days, the
strongest man earned not more than sixpence a day.
But rice and lodging are cheap, and they are more or
less happy at the end of each day’s weary toil.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SILKWORMS AND THEIR FOOD.</i></div>

<p>The hills around Ch’i-chiang were thickly clad with
scrub-oak, on the leaves of which silkworms had been
placed to feed. In Ssŭ-ch’uan sericulture is a most
important industry; every homestead, where mulberry
leaves are procurable, is engaged in it. Small market-towns
are thickly dotted over the whole province, and
at each place a market is held every five days. Thither
agents resort and buy up cocoons and opium at their
respective seasons. Besides the mulberry and the oak,
the leaves of the <i>Cudrania triloba, Hance</i>, are much in
demand for feeding the young worms; and near Chia-ting,
the very centre of silk culture in Ssŭ-ch’uan, I
was informed that these leaves are particularly suited
to the infant palate, and that the silk produced from
this diet is superior in quantity and quality. Frequently
have I seen small wooden tubs filled with white
and yellow cocoons&mdash;the produce of a single little homestead&mdash;exposed
by the roadside for sale. The duty of
nursing, rearing and feeding the worms and of collecting
their food devolves on the women and children, the
former hastening the hatching of the eggs by wearing
them in their breasts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>South of Ch’i-chiang, the wood-oil tree was very
abundant, and banyan and pumelo trees were dotted
about here and there; firs, cypresses, palms, bamboos,
and the mulberry were also to be seen. Of growing
crops, wheat, beans, and hemp&mdash;<i>Abutilon avicennae
Gaert.</i>&mdash;were conspicuous. The small patches of land,
into which Chinese crofts are divided, give ample scope
for careful agriculture. It is, I believe, an established
fact that wheat planted at intervals of from nine to
twelve inches produces a heavier crop than wheat sown
broadcast. By planting, which is here and in China
generally the rule, not only is seed saved but sufficient
room is given for tillering, whereas in sowing, the intervals
are irregular and tillering is cramped. The wild
rose, honeysuckle, and strawberry crept along our path.</p>

<p>It was on leaving Ch’i-chiang on the morning of the
22nd of April that my attention was arrested by a
large white bundle on two legs approaching the city.
As it neared us, it developed into what appeared to be
a huge mass of long white candles half enveloping a
human being, and rising four feet above where, under ordinary
circumstances, the individual’s head ought to be.
Questioning the bundle, I discovered from a series of
sounds that issued from its centre that it was the pith
from which the far-famed “rice” paper is manufactured.
It is the pith of the large-leaved bush-like <i>Fatsia
papyrifera, Benth.</i> and <i>Hook.</i>, which grows luxuriantly
in the province of Kuei-chow, whence it is brought to
Ch’ung-k’ing to be made into sheets. The plant also
grows in Ssŭ-ch’uan, but the stems are not so fully
developed as those produced in the more southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
province. I may as well now describe the process of
manufacture, and save my readers a further reference
to the subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PITH WORKER.</i></div>

<p>On my return to Ch’ung-k’ing from the journey now
described, I was invited to visit a worker in pith after
nightfall. Although somewhat surprised at the hour
named, I accepted the invitation. On arrival, I was
ushered into a badly lighted room, where a man was
sitting at a table with his tools in front of him. These
consisted of a smooth stone, about a foot square and an
inch and a half thick, and a large knife or hatchet with
a short wooden handle. The blade was about a foot
long, two inches broad, and nearly half an inch thick at
the back. It was sharp as a razor. Placing a piece
of round pith on the stone and his left hand on the
top, he rolled the pith backwards and forwards for a
moment until he got it into the required position.
Then, seizing the knife with his right hand, he held
the edge of the blade, after a feint or two, close to the
pith, which he kept rolling to the left with his left
hand until nothing remained to roll; for the pith had,
by the application of the knife, been pared into a square
white sheet of uniform thickness. All that remained
to be done was to square the edges. If the reader will
roll up a sheet of paper, lay it on the table, place the
left hand on the top, and gently unroll it to the left,
he will have a good idea of how the feat was accomplished.
It seemed so easy that I determined to have
a trial. Posing as a professional worker, I succeeded
in hacking the pith, and in nearly maiming myself for
life. A steady hand and a keen eye are required for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the work, and hence it is that the so-called “rice”
paper is manufactured only at night, when the city is
asleep and the makers are not liable to be disturbed.</p>

<p>The third day from Ch’i-chiang brought us to the
Kuei-chow frontier, the road following for the most
part the banks of the Ch’i-chiang River. Coal and
iron are here found in abundance, and the market town
of Kan-shui, which lies within the Ssŭ-ch’uan border, is
famed for the manufacture of the iron pans, without
one of which no house can be looked upon as properly
furnished. Copper is also found at no great distance,
and specimens of the ore, which I forwarded to Shanghai
for analysis, contained thirty per cent. of metal.</p>

<p>It was near the Kuei-chow border that I first came
in contact with the Miao-tzŭ, the aboriginal inhabitants
of that province. I was sauntering along in front of
my followers when, at a bend in the road, I was
suddenly confronted by a couple of neatly-dressed
figures which turned out to be two Miao-tzŭ girls, about
fourteen and sixteen years of age as far as I could guess,
arrayed in short jackets and kilts of a greyish-black
woollen material, with turbans to match. They were
very good looking, and, although somewhat coy, did
not show that abject terror which, under similar circumstances,
would have betrayed the Chinese female.
With heads erect and black eyes lighted up with
astonishment, they passed me by with no uncertain
gait. Although the Miao-Tzŭ are generally supposed
to be confined to Kuei-chow, not a few families are
settled in this corner of Ssŭ-ch’uan. Those who are
interested in this people will find another chapter
specially devoted to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHINESE INNS.</i></div>

<p>Seas of bare rocky mountains met my eyes as I sat
on the borders of Ssŭ-ch’uan and Kuei-chow, and gazed
southwards. It was like a transformation scene. From
smiling fields of poppy, wheat, and beans, we were
suddenly brought face to face with hill-side patches of
the same crops sadly stunted. The poppy, which to
the north was being bled, had not even burst into
flower, and the scanty soil looked barren and profitless.
The rich valleys were still invisible, and the prospect
was very depressing; nor was the feeling in the least
minimised by the appearance of our lodgings for the
night. So bad were they, indeed, that I had to ask
the local authority of Sung-k’an whether he could not
find me more decent quarters. Another room was
hunted up, but I failed to discover any great improvement.
I have occupied hundreds of Chinese inns in
the course of my travels, and I think that, on the whole,
a Chinaman’s own description which I found written
on the wall of a room which I once tenanted in Ssŭ-ch’uan,
errs on the side of leniency. In English garb
it runs thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Within this room you’ll find the rats<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At least a goodly score,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>It must have been the poet’s up-bringing or his being
overpowered by other ills that prevented him from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
finishing the work so well begun. Let me endeavour
to complete the picture&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BAMBOO WATER-WHEELS.</i></div>

<p>To reach T’ung-tzŭ, a range of mountains over three
thousand feet high had to be crossed. The summit
was dotted with smooth, hollowed-out, limestone rocks,
between which the scanty soil was being turned over
by the peasants. On the south side of the range, a
narrow valley, about nine miles in length, down which
flows a stream, leads to the district city. As the latter
is approached, the valley expands from a quarter to
half a mile in breadth, and runs with the stream for
another five miles until it is blocked by a low range of
hills, through which the stream finds its way by a series
of caverns. In the narrower part of the valley, I noticed
a very ingenious contrivance for irrigating the fields.
The stream flows about ten feet below the surrounding
plots, and drains instead of watering them. To utilize
it, a large light bamboo wheel, from forty to fifty feet in
circumference, and two feet thick, was erected. Layers
of split bamboo were inserted at short intervals in
the outside edge as float-boards, and the water rushing
against them caused the wheel to revolve. Short bamboos
closed at the outer end were fixed on the rim at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
slight angle. As the wheel revolved, these bamboos
were immersed and filled with water, and on reaching
the top poured their contents into a wooden trough
raised nearly to the height of the wheel. Bamboo
pipes led the water from the trough to the fields requiring
irrigation. No care was required, and wheel after
wheel was doing its work silently and alone.</p>

<p>Rice is hulled by a somewhat similar process. An
ordinary water-wheel is fitted with a long axle, through
the centre of which two planks at either side of the
wheel are inserted at right angles and project several
feet. As the wheel revolves, the planks descend, catch,
depress, and release a lever, the far end of which is
weighted with a heavy blunt stone about two feet long.
When the lever is released, the stone descends and
plunges into a hollow, usually lined with concrete, into
which the paddy is placed. By a single revolution of
the wheel the lever is depressed and released four times
and, when the hulling is completed, the lever can be
drawn aside and the contents of the hole removed and
winnowed.</p>

<p>I took advantage of a day’s rest at T’ung-tzŭ to follow
up the stream to the point where it enters the
range of hills. The whole valley and the hill-sides
were one mass of poppies in full bloom&mdash;white, mauve,
and white tipped with pink being the chief colours.
The capsules were less rounded, but more elongated
than those of the Ssŭ-ch’uan plant. The Ku-lu, as the
stream is called, enters the hill by three caverns,
emerges through a single cavern some distance beyond,
crosses another valley a few hundred yards in breadth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and at right angles to the T’ung-tzŭ valley, again enters
the hills and, after leaving by another single cavern,
discharges itself into the Ch’ih-shui River. As might
naturally be expected, both valleys are liable to inundation
during the rainy season and, at the time of my
visit, an attempt was being made to cut a tunnel behind
the first range and induce the surplus waters to seek a
nearer passage to the larger river. A mile of tunnel
had already been completed, but a part had fallen in
and hindered the progress of the work. As it seemed
to me, the passage through the first range must always
be liable to be choked by an increase in the volume of
the stream and by floating débris, and little would appear
to have been accomplished beyond scattering to
the winds £10,000 to £12,000, and giving employment
to a large number of men.</p>

<p>There is little of interest to attract the eye of the
traveller between T’ung-tzŭ and Tsun-i Fu, the next
city of any importance on the way to the provincial
capital. The road runs over hills and through valleys,
past coal mines and through poppy-fields, until a few
miles north of the city the country opens out and shows
the usual crops. The population, as everywhere in
Kuei-chow, is scant; and if a field is wanted to relieve
the congested provinces of the Empire, Kuei-chow and
Yün-nan can easily accommodate millions, and feel all
the better for the increase. With the exception of the
Miao-tzŭ, who have been driven into the south of Kuei-chow,
the inhabitants consist of immigrants from Ssŭ-ch’uan,
Hupeh and Hunan, who, for the most part, are
satisfied with scratching small parts of the ground and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
disposing of the opium which they themselves are unable
to consume to the eastern province of Hunan. A
lazier set of people it would be hard to find anywhere.
The mountainous character of the country renders overland
transport excessively difficult, the consequence
being that the products of the soil are exceedingly
cheap and living inexpensive. Ruins of superior stone
buildings are everywhere to be met with, but, instead
of repairing these, the inhabitants are content to raise
wattle and mud walls on the solid foundations, and turn
the floors of the superfluous houses into vegetable gardens.
The Miao-tzŭ must, indeed, have had a hot time
of it. Where forests of oak once stood, only black
charred roots and columns of dressed granite now remain,
to tell the tale of a well-to-do Miao-tzŭ peasantry
in hand to hand conflict with better-armed opponents.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COAL-DUST AS FUEL.</i></div>

<p>How to utilize coal-dust as fuel has always been a
fruitful topic of discussion where coal mines are worked.
I notice that the most recent invention in England is the
admixture of pitch with the dust. Here and elsewhere
in China, clay is the ingredient used; and the mixture,
after being reduced to the necessary consistency by the
addition of water, is placed in moulds, whence it issues,
about two pounds in weight, in the shape of the base
half of a cone, and is then exposed to the sun to dry.
This fuel is fairly tenacious, and will bear considerable
rough transit. From personal experience in Peking, I
may add that ignition is not a difficult matter, and
that a powerful heat results.</p>

<p>The walls of Tsun-i, which we entered on the afternoon
of the 29th of April, are said to contain a popula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>tion
of 45,000 souls. It is a manufacturing city. Wild
silk, gathered from the scrub-oak in the neighbourhood,
is spun and woven into a coarse fabric, which is largely
exported through Ssŭ-ch’uan to the central and eastern
provinces. It is a peculiarity of Kuei-chow towns that
there are no suburbs outside the walls; but, when the
struggles that have taken place within the province
and the consequent insecurity are considered, their
absence is not a matter for surprise.</p>

<p>About forty miles to the south of Tsun-i, we struck
the left bank of the Wu Chiang, which here flows with
a swift current through a deep limestone gorge in an
east-north-east direction. Looking down into the gorge,
I could make out on the opposite bank a solid platform
of masonry, over which dangled a row of iron chains or
rods into the river. Descending through accumulations
of building materials, we soon reached a similar platform,
where I discovered that a great catastrophe had
recently occurred. Seven months before our visit the
chains or hooked rods&mdash;each about a yard long&mdash;for
supporting the roadway, had been successfully stretched,
built into the masonry on either side and the ends
fixed into the solid rock. The side suspension chains,
which were carried over stone turrets on either side of
the piers, were in process of being stretched, when the
whole structure collapsed, carrying with it a large number
of workmen, many of whom were drowned or
fatally injured. Their graves are to be seen on the
left bank of the river. The turrets were all carried
away, and nothing remained but the piers, the severed
chains, and many of the planks which had formed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
roadway. In manufacturing the chains, which was
done on the spot&mdash;the workshops were still standing&mdash;local
iron, which appeared to be of an inferior quality
and to have been insufficiently malleated, had been
used. The bridge was rebuilt in the year of our visit
(1882), but iron from Yün-nan was employed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE KUNG-T’AN RIVER.</i></div>

<p>The Wu Chiang, or, as it is called near its mouth,
the Kung-t’an River, after a course of about five hundred
miles, enters the Yang-tsze at the city of Fu Chou,
seventy-two miles to the east of Ch’ung-k’ing. Owing
to rapids, it is unnavigable until it approaches the
province of Ssŭ-ch’uan; but even in its short navigable
course of over a hundred miles above its junction with
the Yang-tsze it is an important trade highway. By
this route, north-eastern Kuei-chow is supplied with
salt from Ssŭ-ch’uan, sending in return gall-nuts and
other minor products. At one time it formed part of
the great commercial highway between Canton and
Western China, which has practically ceased to exist
since the opening of the Yang-tsze to steam navigation.</p>

<p>A brief glance across the Wu Chiang warned me
that there was no time to tarry on the left bank, for
the road could be seen zig-zagging up a gulley on the
opposite shore. Collecting our forces, which had scattered
on a tour of inspection, we descended to the
river, a stream sixty yards in breadth, and were ferried
across by detachments in a rickety old boat. A
weary climb of two hours, past disused iron mines overgrown
with brushwood, brought us to the Kuan-ai
Customs barrier, perched on the summit of the range.
Beyond the barrier we obtained a splendid view of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
country to the south; barren, treeless peaks, on the
same level as ourselves&mdash;three to four thousand feet&mdash;lay
before us, cheerless, uninhabited, lifeless. What
a picture! Where are the Miao-tzŭ that used to till
these fields and tend their herds on the mountain sides?
They were butchered and their bones are rotting underneath.
Northern Kuei-chow is a huge graveyard, with
no monuments to mark the fierce struggle against extortion
and oppression, of rude weapons against foreign
arms of precision. Justice is a fine thing to talk about
and inculcate, but a hard thing to practise.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ARRIVAL AT KUEI-YANG.</i></div>

<p>Three miles from the river my followers clamoured
for a day’s rest. Although only a three days’ journey
from Kuei-yang, the capital of the province, where I
proposed to make a short stay, I was compelled to
accede to their request. Twenty miles may seem a
poor day’s work; but my readers should bear in mind
that roads, in the proper sense of the word, do not
exist, and that the mountain paths which we have been
travelling have been sadly neglected. During the
whole of my time in Kuei-chow I never once saw a cart,
the entire trade&mdash;such as it is&mdash;being conducted on the
backs of bipeds and quadrupeds. A nearer acquaintance
with the country between the Wu Chiang and Kuei-yang
failed to leave on my mind a livelier impression
than that derived from the panorama of desolation as
seen from the Kuan-ai barrier. During the day here
and there a hut or a poppy-patch was the only sign
of human existence, and at night came the miserable
village full of lethargic opium-sodden inhabitants.</p>

<p>Ten miles of grassy downs and fifteen miles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
barren mountain sides constitute the approach to the
provincial capital. At the village, which lies between,
an escort of eight soldiers, two mounted officers, and a
host of runners from the Magistrate’s Yamên, awaited
us to protect me from the dangers of the wilderness.
The occasional huts give place to guard-houses, which
would seem to imply that the country is not so safe as
it looks. Passing through an archway bridging the
road between two steep mountain peaks, where the
officer at the receipt of customs glared greedily at our
caravan; and, rounding a mountain side, we soon
caught a glimpse of Kuei-yang lying in a plain far
below us. On the left is the graveyard of the city, its
white stones like glittering specks dotting the hill side.
A white wall surrounds the town; and numerous green
trees rising above the house-tops were suggestive of
coolness and shade. But all is not gold that glitters,
and there was soon revealed to us an ordinary Chinese
city containing the usual marks of decay.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 6th of May&mdash;the day after
our arrival&mdash;I spent a very pleasant half-hour with
the Governor of the province, who was courtesy itself.
His Excellency was deeply interested in the subject of
the navigation of the Upper Yang-tsze by steam, and
showed complete familiarity with the sayings of the
Shanghai vernacular press. He pressed me to stay a
few days; but the heat was oppressive, and I determined
to push on to Yün-nan without delay. To His
Excellency I owe much; he was good enough to send
orders along the route that I was to be accommodated
in the official rest-houses as much as possible, so that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
was enabled to get rid of the crowds which collect and
gaze with glassy eyes at the unfortunate foreigner. It
is difficult to satisfy a Chinese crowd; one may sit or
stand before one’s room-door in an inn for hours, yet
the inquisitiveness remains unabated. Enter the room,
and every crack in the woodwork of the walls is occupied
by peering eyes, while the paper windows are
quickly converted into sieves by moistened finger-tips,
and black glittering orbs are glued to them. A boot
deftly aimed gives momentary, but only momentary,
relief. Kuei-chow is not a chief sinner in this respect.
In Western China, Ssŭ-ch’uan undoubtedly takes the
palm.</p>

<p>During the afternoon of my stay in Kuei-yang I
made a flying perambulation of the city. In the
southern part, the shops were large and apparently
prosperous, and the streets, which were fairly broad,
were crowded. Foreign cottons brought from Hankow
by way of the Tung-t’ing Lake and the Yuan River
were plentifully displayed. I shall have occasion to
refer again to this route, which was followed by the
unfortunate Margary on his way across China to
Burmah.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 7th of May, we turned our
faces westwards towards the province of Yün-nan, the
capital of which I hoped to reach before the end of the
month. Soon after leaving the west gate of Kuei-yang,
we met a number of carriers with long round baskets
slung at the ends of poles in the usual Chinese manner.
The exceptional speed at which they were going tempted
me to examine their loads, and most unwillingly did
they submit, for they were bearing eastward to Hunan
burdens of living insects of great industrial value.
They were white wax insects in their scales, which had
been collected in the An-shun prefecture further west,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
packed in layers of trays to ensure a free current of air
and thus prevent their escape during their long journey.
The lamps which the owners, who accompanied the
porters on foot, carried, told me that the tiny insects
were being hurried night and day to their destination.
The whole subject of white wax insects and their valuable
product will be found detailed in Chapter XI.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TERRIFIC HAILSTORM.</i></div>

<p>Ten miles west of Kuei-yang is the main coal-field
for supplying the provincial capital with fuel. The
road winds among and over low hills untouched by the
hoe of the peasant; rank grass and brushwood tell the
tale of a meagre population content to exist on the
produce of the narrow valleys&mdash;patches of barley or
wheat, and poppy and rice in their season. Beyond the
hills, a valley leads to the district city of Ch’ing-chên,
and here a surprising sight met the eye. Up to the
very walls of the city stretched an immense poppy-field,
the stems fresh and erect, but hardly a capsule remaining.
Here at last, thought I, have the authorities in a
fit of virtuous indignation advanced beyond issuing
proclamations laden with threats of punishment; here
surely must be a Magistrate who has a will of his own
and the courage to carry it into effect. Alas! I wronged
him. ’Twas another celestial authority that did the
deed. On the night of the 2nd of May, a terrible hailstorm
burst over the district, destroying not only the
growing crops but even playing havoc within the walls.
The streets were full of broken tiles, many of the roofs
having succumbed to the hailstones, which were described
to me as weighing as much as seven and even
eight ounces. The capsules, which were scattered on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the ground, had all been collected for the sake of the
sweet cooking-oil which is obtained from the seed, and
of the cakes which are manufactured from the seed
itself. Six miles by six represented the area over which
the hail had descended. The stems and branches of the
roadside trees, which were all but denuded of leaves,
looked as if they had been hacked with a blunt axe.
Rapeseed, beans, wheat, and barley, which were growing
in scant patches to the west of the city, were
flattened with the ground.</p>

<p>In this part of the country, cultivation is confined to
the neighbourhood of towns and villages. The distance
between Ch’ing-chên and An-p’ing, the next district
city, is twenty miles; and, if we except the poppy which
was growing abundantly near the latter, there was no
cultivation worthy of the name. Grass-covered plains,
once smiling fields, intercepted by curious conical hills
partly clad with brushwood and bracken, are happy
hunting grounds for herds of tame buffaloes. Truly,
the land of the Miao-tzŭ was devastated, and its inhabitants
butchered and scattered. Poverty reigns along
the highroad. Three miles west of Ch’ing-chên, we
stopped for breakfast at a hamlet overlooking a tributary
of the Wu Chiang. Neither chair nor table was
procurable; but they were hardly necessary, for it did
not take long to put away the remains of my dinner of
the previous evening. Here I found that the knowledge
possessed by the local escorts is not above suspicion.
Sitting on the stone bridge which spans the stream just
mentioned, I asked them the name and destination of
the latter; but I failed to receive a satisfactory answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
One of the soldiers, however, who volunteered the
statement that the bridge on which I was sitting had
nine arches, was somewhat non-plussed to find, on being
sent to count, that it was two short of the number he
gave.</p>

<p>An-p’ing has not yet recovered from the ravages
of the civil war; the walls are in a state of decay, and
many of the houses which they encircle are represented
by heaps of ruins. The surrounding country is almost
entirely inhabited by Miao-tzŭ, whose hamlets are
perched on inaccessible hill-tops&mdash;stone refuges occupying
the commanding heights. When hard pressed, they
drove their cattle into the latter for safety and, sheltering
themselves behind the walls, bade defiance to their
assailants.</p>

<p>The villages, through which the road passes between
An-p’ing and An-shun, are of a non-Chinese type. The
walls of the houses are built of loose stones and are very
thick, the roofs being composed of broad stone slabs.
The inmates appeared to be of a degraded race, and
have, in all probability, a strain of Miao-tzŭ blood.
The men were dressed in sombre Chinese clothes, while
the women were inclined to gaudy colours.</p>

<p>At one of these villages it was market day; herds
of oxen, horses, and pigs were on the ground, and the
women, arrayed in all the colours of the rainbow and
ornamented with silver earrings, bangles and rings,
were hurrying in with baskets of eggs and vegetables.
In the market were four slender, sinewy Miao-tzŭ men,
somewhat curiously dressed. Black cloth bands encircled
their foreheads, loose gowns of similar material,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
fastened with girdles, covered them from neck to ankle,
huge silver earrings swung from their left ears and
their feet were encased in straw sandals. Bowls of
opium were being hawked about the village, and I was
told that the Miao-tzŭ, although extensive cultivators
of the poppy, do not themselves smoke the drug.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AN SHUN-FU.</i></div>

<p>An-shun is approached through a long valley, which
contracts as the city is neared. At the eastern end,
the road, which is lined with memorial stone archways,
ascends a gentle slope&mdash;the graveyard of the town&mdash;to
the walls. From the gate we looked down into a broad
street, crowded with people engaged in business. On
stalls at either side, goods of all kinds were plentifully
displayed, and the shops behind them were large and
apparently prosperous. Ponies laden with salt jostled
us in the gateway, and I found, on enquiry, that An-shun
is supplied with this necessity of life by way of
the Yung-ning River, which enters the Yang-tsze at the
district city of Na-chi, and is the most important trade
highway to Western Kuei-chow. This route, which I
followed in 1883, will be found described in a subsequent
chapter.</p>

<p>The main roads of China are each divided into
stages, only one of which can, with convenience and
comfort to the traveller, be accomplished in a day.
The plan which I followed was invariably as follows.
Rising at daybreak, I had a cup of coffee or tea, pushed
on to the first hamlet or village, where we all breakfasted,
travelled till noon when we lunched at the most
convenient spot, and arrived at the end of the stage
about four or five o’clock in the afternoon. Inns were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
not always available during the day, and at our first
halting place after leaving An-shun, we took possession
of a house which we shared with a couple of carriers,
who seemed to prefer a whiff of the opium pipe to eating.
On one occasion only, as far as I can recollect,
was I refused temporary lodgment, the inmates, as a
rule, being only too willing to shelter us for a few cash.
As a matter of fact, they had little to fear, for they had
nothing to steal.</p>

<p>Chên-ning Chou, which was the end of the stage on
the 10th of May, is a poor city, built on a hill slope, and
consists of one decent street and a number of dilapidated
thoroughfares. It lies at the western end of a
valley, which was filled with yellow wheat and barley,
submerged paddy-land, and poppy-fields. Our landlord
told me that, previous to the rebellion, the walls sheltered
from seven to eight thousand families, now, however,
reduced to a thousand. A mile to the west of
Chên-ning we came upon a cave close to the highroad.
It was formed of a single limestone dome, which has
been converted into a temple. To us it presented the
appearance of a poorhouse, for our entrance aroused
a crowd of squalid beggars, who had taken up their
quarters in its cool shade. They did not look as if they
had a very close acquaintance with the clear, limpid
stream which flows through it and enters a limestone
hill fifty yards beyond. We were no longer the only
travellers going west; a number of men were carrying
silver to Yün-nan to purchase opium. The value of
the drug, its small bulk and superiority, enable it to be
carried across the province of Kuei-chow to Hunan and
other provinces at a profit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PAI-SHUI RIVER.</i></div>

<p>The Pai-shui, or “White Water” river, spanned by
a stone bridge of five arches at the eastern end of the
village of Huang-kuo-shu, goes south to join the northern
section of the Canton or West River. It is a shallow
stream thirty yards in breadth and forms a beautiful
waterfall in the rear of the village, creeping leisurely
over the brown rocks and falling about a hundred feet.
In the temple of the “Dragon Prince” we spread our
mid-day meal, having had to fast since daybreak, the
hamlets on the road west of Chên-ning being unable
to supply us even with a single egg. A series of
weary ascents and descents ultimately landed us in the
small village of P’o-kung, which had recently been the
scene of a conflagration. Ten days before our arrival
it was all but consumed, and the inhabitants were
huddled together amidst its charred remains, still wanting
in courage or in funds to re-erect their homes.</p>

<p>Is there no level ground anywhere in the province
of Kuei-chow? This was the question that suggested
itself to me as I gained the ridge that rises to the west
of P’o-kung. The answer lay ahead. Waves of conical
hills and mountain ranges beyond seemed to block the
passage to Yün-nan. Down and up, and down again,
brought us to a valley, extending for miles, at the far
end of which rests the prosperous city of Lang-t’ai
T’ing, famous for the superiority of its opium. Some
miles from its walls we were met by two escorts, one
sent by the Sub-prefect, the other by the Colonel. As
we approached, they dropped on their knees and bade
me welcome. The military escort, which was composed
of five soldiers armed with matchlocks and four with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
banners, had evidently taken advantage of their excursion
to do a little shooting. One man had bagged half
a dozen pigeons, and a bird of about the same size with
a perfect yellow plumage, which I failed to recognize.
As every one is aware, the Chinese do many things in
a way the exact reverse of what we consider right and
proper. How should a soldier carry his musket? Is it
easier to carry the stock or the barrel over the shoulder?
My escort preferred to handle the barrel.</p>

<p>On arrival at Lang-t’ai, the Colonel, to whom I sent
a message of thanks for his foresight and precaution,
pressed me to stay and witness a review that was to be
held in a couple of days; but the comparatively cool
weather, and the fact that I had already seen enough of
his soldiers and their little ways, decided me to decline
the kind invitation.</p>

<p>Lang-t’ai lies low, and by the eastern approach
nothing is visible but a part of the wall, the town itself
being obscured by dense foliage. A thick mist concealed
everything from view as we left the following
morning. After struggling for two hours among the
hills that overlook the city on the north-west, we
cleared the mist and entered a coal district where the
miners were hard at work. A splendid view was obtained
from the Wang-shan temple on the ridge where
we breakfasted; the Lang-wang Shan, the highest
mountain in the province, towered on our right. Under
the summit, which is of bare rock, there is a cave&mdash;the
“Cave of the Spirits”&mdash;which has a very wide reputation,
and, as a consequence, is much visited by devotees.
As we passed, pilgrims were burning joss-paper far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
below it. Half-way down on the western side we were
overtaken by a terrific thunderstorm, which continued
far into the night. When we reached the grass-covered
plain that lies below, I took refuge in my chair; but
the violent gusts of wind, which accompanied the sheets
of descending water, soon wrenched off the rain covers
and exposed us to the full blast of the storm.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE VILLAGE OF MAO-K’OU.</i></div>

<p>Wet to the skin we entered the village of Mao-k’ou,
which consists of one street, with numerous gardens
surrounded by hedges of cactus, on the left bank of a
stream fifty yards in breadth, which issues from a gorge
a few hundred yards above the village. Here there
was no resisting the appeal for a day’s rest which was
at once made to me. A carrier’s luggage is of the
lightest possible description; the single suit of clothes
in which he stands is, as a rule, all that he possesses,
and when that is reduced to a pulp, it has to be washed
and dried before he can again venture out.</p>

<p>I spent the morning of our day of rest on the pebbly
strand of the Mao-k’ou river, which goes south to swell
the upper waters of the north branch of the West
River, in the province of Kwang-si. Numerous fossils
are to be found here, and I purchased three different
specimens from the landlord of our inn. The current
of the river is very rapid.</p>

<p>On leaving Mao-k’ou on the following morning, we
ascended its left bank five hundred yards before attempting
the crossing; our boats did not reach the
right bank until we were opposite the village. An undulating
upland stretches westward, covered with rank
wild grass, affording excellent cover for game, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
plentiful. Pheasants crowed all round us, and took
wing when we approached too close. In the middle of
this grassy waste we were caught up by a caravan of
twenty ponies, laden with bamboo hats, on their way
from Kuei-yang to Yün-nan Fu. They were strong,
hardy little animals, game to the very last. Each had
a load of three hundred and sixty hats; and I found,
when I afterwards saw them turned loose to graze,
that not one had a whole back. One poor beast was a
pitiful sight; it had a sore at least a foot long, and
down almost to its ribs. The flies, attracted by the
smell in a temperature of 90° F., rendered its life miserable,
and I offered to buy it at a reasonable price and
put it out of agony, but the owner was devoid of the
least spark of humanity and would not listen to my
entreaties. He even grumbled loudly when I made
him take off half the load and distribute it amongst
the others. The greed of the ordinary Chinese leaves
little room for kindness to man’s humbler assistants.
An instance occurs to me at the moment. I once
visited the Great Wall, and, as visitors do, hired a
donkey to carry me up the rough Nan-k’ou Pass. I
had not proceeded far when a horrid stench assailed
my nostrils; its continuance baffled me until a sudden
lurch of the saddle revealed a sickening sight. Needless
to say, I walked the rest of the way.</p>

<p>Towards the western end of the grassy upland, the
fir and the oak are dotted about and relieve the monotony
of the barren undulations, which are succeeded by
a coal-producing valley and two mountain ranges following
closely on each other, being separated by only a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
rice fields. The village of Kuan-tzŭ-yao, which lies
behind the ranges, marks the boundary of the bare,
uncultivated hills. A reddish tilled soil now covers
immense carboniferous deposits. If my reader is as
tired of hearing of these uninteresting mountain ranges
as I was in crossing them, he will be relieved to know
that the plateau of Yün-nan will soon be reached.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE YÜN-NAN FRONTIER.</i></div>

<p>A journey of three days and a half from Kuan-tzŭ-yao
along cultivated valleys, and including two more
ascents and descents, brought us early in the afternoon
of the 20th of May to the Yün-nan frontier. During
this time two new crops put in an appearance&mdash;buckwheat
and oats. I saw, too, a new method of manuring
the fields. For some days I had been puzzled to account
for the peculiar growth of certain trees whose
branches were very short, and for which I could obtain
no satisfactory explanation; but all at once I came
upon a peasant hacking off the branches, and another
ploughing them into the rice fields. A barren waste
leads up to the frontier town of Shên-ching-kuan, where
we were received with the usual Chinese salute of three
guns. Stopping for a rest, I discovered that the little
town possesses, besides its two memorial archways,
four stone lions, two facing Kuei-chow, with imitation
scales to represent the rainy character of that province,
and two facing west, with imitation scales and dust,
indicating the rainy as well as the windy reputation of
Yün-nan.</p>

<p>My Ssŭ-ch’uan followers entertained a wholesome
dread of the latter province. For some days they had
been talking of the miseries that they would have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
endure in the matter of food and lodging, and they had
come to the conclusion that the only possible reason
that could have tempted me to travel in that remote
region was to <i>chih Yün-nan k’u</i>, or partake of the bitterness
of Yün-nan. Often did they discuss, in my
hearing, the motive which led me to question everybody
and everything, and transfer the answers to my
note-book; but all they seemed able to arrive at was
that I was not doing it for nothing.</p>

<p>The excitement of entering a new province raised
the spirits of my bearers, who hurried me along the red
sandy road, which slopes past several nullahs to a plain
only partly cultivated, because liable to inundation.
Could it be possible? It seemed almost too good to be
true. Lumbering towards us came a couple of bullocks,
dragging an apology for a cart behind them. The faces
of my men were a study; with one or two exceptions,
they had never seen this method of transport, and they
stood and gazed at this thing on wheels, which, proud
as they were of their province, was not in use among
their Ssŭ-ch’uan hills. Rude though the vehicle was,
it was a welcome innovation, for it presaged better
roads and a level country. Two low, thick wooden
wheels, joined together by a ponderous beam, supported
a small platform of planks encircled by a framework
about two feet in height, while a single short shaft
projected from the platform in front.</p>

<p>P’ing-i Hsien, the first district city across the Yün-nan
frontier, is built on the south face of a low hill
overlooking an extensive well-watered plain, which was
covered with wheat, nigh unto harvest, and poppies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
It is a great wheat country, and the district is one of
the chief feeders of the provincial capital. Oats, too,
were growing on the hills which bound the plain on the
eastern side; but there was a decided want of straw,
for the stalks had only shot a couple of inches above
ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EXPLORING A CAVE.</i></div>

<p>Less than a mile beyond the city we came upon the
cave mentioned by Margary in his journal. Lighting
our lamps, we explored it for a few hundred yards in a
straight line, from its mouth to the point where it
branches off to the right. In the far interior, huge
stalactites hung from the roof. The utter silence of the
cavern, broken only by our stumbling over the rough
floor, and the weird appearance of the contorted limestone
lighted up by our dim lamps, did not tempt us to
tarry in the dank and cheerless atmosphere. It had
thundered and rained heavily over-night; and, about a
mile and a half to the west of the cave, the high-road
was blocked by a deep, raging torrent, twenty yards in
breadth. My followers, always intent upon a rest,
advocated a return to P’ing-i, until the violence of the
torrent had abated; but to this I would not listen.
Fortunately, a native of the place soon came upon the
scene, and mildly suggested that there was a path across
some hills farther east. Scouting the statement, they
clamoured all the more for a return to dry quarters.
Seeing, however, that he was in earnest, I resolved to
try the hills, and told my men to follow me or remain
where they were till able to ford the torrent. As the
rain increased in violence and the atmosphere became
sensibly colder, they agreed to accompany me, stating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
at the same time, their firm conviction that we were
going on a fool’s errand. The native proved to be right,
however, for we found an excellent pathway, and from
the ridge overlooking the other side of the plain I tried
to make out the raging stream that had just baffled us.
It was nowhere to be seen, and I soon learned that we
had already crossed it by a natural bridge, for it entered
a cavern only a few hundred yards from the high-road,
the entrance being concealed by a bend in the hills.
This adventure cost us our breakfast, as it was noon
ere we reached the first hamlet. These underground
rivers are very numerous in Kuei-chow and Yün-nan;
the composition of the rocks, which are of lime and
sandstone, facilitates the drainage of the valleys and
plains, which would otherwise be converted into lakes.</p>

<p>In the hills to the west of the plain, coal is found
in abundance, the interstices in the walls of the houses
being frequently filled with black lumps instead of
stone. The villagers told us that snow falls in winter,
and that the climate is exceedingly cold. On the bare
treeless highlands beyond, potatoes, buckwheat, oats,
and a little poppy, were being cultivated.</p>

<p>As a rule, a Chinese has little to gain by showing
civility to a foreigner, be he official, merchant,
or missionary; and courtesy, even of the barest description,
is thoroughly appreciated in a land where
stone-throwing, mobbing, and threatening are too often
indulged in with impunity. The marked attention paid
to us at Pai-shui, the end of the first stage from P’ing-i
Hsien, was a very pleasant surprise. The small local
officials, with an escort, met me some miles from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
village, and hurried on to receive me at the gate. A
Taotai, who had been travelling in my company on his
way to Western Yün-nan, and with whom I had afterwards
a pleasant chat about those terrible Kuei-chow
roads and our struggles to get the best inns, had just
preceded me, and taken up his quarters in the official
rest-house; but a comfortable room was quickly procured
for me, the authorities, much against my will, having
gone the length of ejecting a number of occupiers.
As we left early next morning, the authorities awaited
us at the opposite gate of their once-walled village, to
speed us on our way. It would greatly lessen the
misery of travelling in China if such courtesy were
more frequently forthcoming.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE TRANSPORTATION OF COPPER.</i></div>

<p>The people in the neighbourhood of Pai-shui are
very much afflicted with goître, especially the women,
and the idea is prevalent among them that the impurities
contained in the salt which they consume is the
cause of the malady. Here we came across a consignment
of red copper for the metropolis, transported on
the backs of nearly four hundred mules and ponies from
the mines of Tung-ch’uan Fu to Pe-sê T’ing, the head
of navigation of the West River, in the province of
Kwang-si. It seemed a roundabout way of sending
copper north, but I was informed that on one occasion,
when shipments used to be despatched by way of the
Yang-tsze, a great storm arose and overwhelmed more
than a hundred junks and their cargoes. I heard afterwards
that peculation had probably more to do with
the loss than a storm.</p>

<p>The city of Chan-i Chou, fifteen miles to the west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of Pai-shui, lies in the north of an immense plain,
famous throughout Western China as the breeding
ground of the sturdy Yün-nan pony. Brood mares and
their foals were grazing on the large grass fields, which
occupied no mean part of the plain. A stream, spanned
by a good three-arched stone bridge, flows south past
the east gate of the city on its way to join the northern
branch of the West River. It was at one time a section
of the route by which lead was carried from the north
of Yün-nan to Tonquin. Consignments were conveyed
by boat from Chan-i Chou to Ma-kai, a place fifty miles
to the south, and thence overland to Mêng-tzŭ Hsien,
on the head waters of the Song-koi, now the residence
of a French Consul.</p>

<p>Rain descended in torrents during the night of our
stay in Chan-i, and the dawn of the 23rd of May was
not accompanied by the usual movements and noises
that betokened an early start. On the contrary, I was
soon waited upon by a deputation, which begged me,
on account of the rains, to defer my departure for a day;
but the fact that I was almost in the presence of my
goal compelled me to resist their demand. After two
hours spent in arguing, we trooped sullenly out of the
city. The plain, which on the previous afternoon was
bright with its golden crops of wheat and barley, was
now cold and cheerless; the road was one mass of mud
in which we sank to the knees; a great part of the
surrounding country was under water; and the rain
fell in sheets.</p>

<p>The hamlets in the neighbourhood were poor in the
extreme. Stopping for breakfast, we borrowed a room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and despatched a youngster to forage for a table and
eggs. The way in which these people live is astounding:
they occupy rooms begrimed with smoke&mdash;chimneys
are considered superfluous&mdash;willingly sharing them
with dogs, pigs, fowls, and insect pests.</p>

<p>The unceasing downpour obliged us to abandon the
idea of completing a day’s stage, which we broke at the
market town of Mien-tien, having accomplished only
twelve miles, or half the distance necessary to ensure
decent accommodation. We were quartered in a loft
over a stable, where a dozen ponies, unable like ourselves
to proceed farther, were installed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>QUEEN’S BIRTHDAY DINNER.</i></div>

<p>As the morrow was the anniversary of Her Majesty’s
Birthday, I determined to secure a good dinner for the
occasion; my tinned provisions had long since given
out, and I was entirely dependent on local supplies. I
succeeded in purchasing a fowl and a few potatoes,
which we carried with us over the plain of yellow-ochre
soil which lies between Chan-i and Ma-lung Chou.</p>

<p>At the latter city, I experienced very considerable
civility at the hands of the chief civil official, who paid
me a visit, and, being a native of Ch’ung-k’ing, plied
me with many questions regarding his Ssŭ-ch’uan home.
He also added considerably to our larder, which was
now in a very prosperous condition indeed. He complained
of the poverty of his jurisdiction, stating that
the people over whom he ruled were nearly all poor
immigrants from Ssŭ-ch’uan, who, owing to the barrenness
of the soil, could hardly earn enough to keep
clothes on their backs.</p>

<p>We halted for the night at a hamlet ten miles from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Ma-lung, where we secured a single room for our whole
party. After I had had a corner of it partitioned off
by a mat, the cooking of the dinner commenced; but,
there being no chimney, the interior soon became so
thick as to necessitate a removal into the fresh air.
A table was brought and placed outside a back door,
and the meal spread under Heaven’s starry vault.
Here my little dog and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves;
and even now, after the lapse of some years, I have
very pleasant memories of that sumptuous dinner, probably
because I took special care in the catering. If
there is a bitterness in the memory, it is that the little,
fearless, faithful, intelligent, amusing sharer of that
repast, the companion of all my travels, is no more.</p>

<p>The inquisitiveness of the Chinese is hard to bear
with equanimity. I sat down to breakfast the following
morning in what I took to be an uninhabited house, for
it consisted of two gables and a roof without a stick of
furniture. The necessary chair and table we had, as
usual, borrowed. No sooner was the cloth spread, than
all the goîtred old women of the village trooped in,
each carrying a tub of old garments steeped in water,
and proceeded in the most matter of fact way to wash.
The splashing and watching were endurable; but when
one of them proceeded to light a fire on the floor, I felt
that we had reached the last straw, and bundled them
out without ceremony, tubs and all. They looked upon
the climax as a good joke.</p>

<p>Following the road over weary red highlands only
partly cultivated, we sighted, on the afternoon of the
26th of May, a large sheet of water, which, as we ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>proached,
we found to be swarming with wild duck. At
Yang-lin, which is built on the south-western margin of
the Sung-ming Lake, we occupied a room in a new inn,
and were regaled with excellent fish from the clear
water we had just passed. How easy it is for a Chinese
official to show his contempt for a foreigner. On the
way to Yang-lin, I was provided with an escort in the
shape of a small boy of thirteen, wearing a sword nearly
as long as himself, who turned out to be fonder of bird-nesting
than of affording protection and assistance!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A GLORIOUS VIEW.</i></div>

<p>A broad stone road, in excellent repair, leads from
Yang-lin to the rim of the plain in which lies the capital
of Yün-nan. Half-way we caught a glimpse of a lake
to the south-west; but it was not till the rim was
reached that the glorious expanse of water, backed by
a mountain range, burst upon our view. The city itself
was still concealed by the north-eastern continuation of
the rim, which juts into the plain, dotted with houses
and trees. Yün-nan Fu lies near the northern shore
of the Lake; and, after descending the low rim, we
followed the road westward for a short distance, then
turned due north, and, after a couple of miles, struck
the south-eastern corner of the wall. No escort met
us; no attention was paid to us, beyond a demand for
my card, as we entered the south gate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="center">THROUGH NORTH-EASTERN YÜN-NAN TO THE
YANG-TSZE.</p>

<div class="nobreak blockquot">

<p>Yün-nan Fu is a walled city, over three miles in
circuit, 6420 feet above the level of the sea and at a
short distance from the north-eastern shore of the lake,
with which it was formerly connected by a canal. The
southern half of the square is thickly populated, while
the northern half consists of swamp and vegetable gardens.
The city was shorn of its ancient glory by the
outbreak of the Mohammedan rebellion, which raged
for years round it and in the northern part of the province.
The old and extensive suburbs are gradually
being rebuilt from their ruins. Outside the south gate
(there are six gates) there is now a long street of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
depôts for the salt, which comes from the wells to the
north-west. The city itself is kept decidedly clean;
bullock carts daily go round and collect the garbage
from the streets, which are fairly broad for a Chinese
town. What strikes the traveller most, in passing
through these streets thronged with well-dressed and
evidently well-to-do foot-passengers, is the large admixture
of non-Chinese features. Here Mohammedans,
Chinese, Shans, and Lolos, and mixtures of these
races, jostle each other in the market place and in the
daily business of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COURTESY OF MISSIONARIES.</i></div>

<p>During my two days’ stay in the city, I received
every possible kindness at the hands of the members of
the two missionary bodies at work there&mdash;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Missions
Etrangères de Paris</span> and the China Inland Mission. At
the handsome palace of the French Bishop, I met a
Father from Ta-li Fu, who gave me such a glowing
account of Western Yün-nan, that I at once made up
my mind to visit that part of the province on a future
occasion, a resolution which I was fortunately able to
carry out.</p>

<p>The good Bishop handed me a letter which he had
just received from Mr. Colquhoun, from P’u-êrh Fu,
stating that his funds were all but exhausted, and
requesting a loan to enable him to proceed from Ta-li,
whither he was bound, to Bhamo. I at once arranged
with the Bishop to despatch a messenger with sixty
taels of silver; but Mr. Colquhoun succeeded in obtaining
funds from the China Inland Mission at Ta-li, and,
ere my messenger reached that city, he and his companion,
Mr. Wahab, had left on their westward journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>To speak of Yün-nan Fu without a reference to the
famous tea, for which it is the entrepôt, would be a
serious omission. P’u-êrh tea, so named from the
department in which it is widely grown, is the leaf of
the <i>Camellia thea Link.</i>, and for purposes of transit is
steamed and made up into cakes, which find their way
to the remotest parts of the Empire. Much of the leaf,
however, is brought to the city of P’u-êrh from the
Shan States, beyond the southern frontier of Yün-nan.
It varies in price, according to quality, from tenpence
to one shilling and fivepence a pound; but the cost of
overland transit is so great as to virtually exclude it
from the foreign market.</p>

<p>The lake, known in books as the Tien Ch’ih, and
colloquially as the K’un-ming&mdash;the name of the district
in which the city of Yün-nan is situated&mdash;is a fine
expanse of water, said to be seventy miles long, and in
some places to attain a breadth of twenty miles. These
figures are, however, very much exaggerated. The lake
drains into the Yang-tsze, an artificial channel having
been cut, to prevent flooding, from a point on its south-western
shore to the river which flows past An-ning
Chow, a city to the west of the provincial capital.
Junks and passenger boats of fair size navigate the lake
between the cities and villages that lie on and near its
shores. In 1883 it was my own fate to be a passenger
on its waters.</p>

<p>At Yün-nan Fu a number of trade routes converge
and connect it with the Yang-tsze, Burmah, the Song-koi,
and the West River; but I will not dwell upon
them now. They will be found discussed at some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
length in Chapter XII., which is specially devoted to
the trade of Western and South-Western China.</p>

<p>I had now reached the place which I had fixed upon
as my farthest point, and, having attained the object of
my journey, I resolved to strike the Yang-tsze at Hsü-chou
Fu, following in the main the route traversed six
years before by the Grosvenor Mission on its way to
Yün-nan Fu to enquire into the death of Margary.
With an <i>au revoir</i> to the city on the morning of the
31st of May, we began to retrace our steps to Yang-lin,
where the Kuei-yang and Hsü-chou roads to Yün-nan
Fu meet. For some days previous to our arrival in the
provincial capital, rain had considerably interfered with
our progress, nor, when we proceeded to return to
Yang-lin, did the province belie its reputation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A PRUDENT CHAIR-BEARER.</i></div>

<p>It was during one of these downpours that an incident
occurred which deserves a passing notice. Several
of my followers were opium smokers, and one of my
bearers had contracted a great craving for the drug.
He was somewhat disreputable in appearance, but a
willing worker. His baggage consisted of the clothes
on his back and a small bundle, containing his opium
pipe and the necessary paraphernalia for smoking. I
observed when leaving Yün-nan Fu that the bundle
had assumed larger dimensions; but certain speculations
which I had made as to its contents were soon
proved to be erroneous and altogether wide of the
mark.</p>

<p>A few miles to the west of Yang-lin, a halt was
called for a rest and the cakes on a roadside stall were
quickly bought up and devoured. Sitting apart on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
edge of the stone road the opium smoker thus addressed
another of my bearers:&mdash;“How is it that you are all
eating and drinking, and I haven’t a single cash to
follow your example?” The other put his thumb to
his mouth and, pretending to inhale, pronounced the
single word “Opium,” at which the smoker smiled and
was silent. Next day we were suddenly overtaken by
a sharp rainstorm, and, when the other bearers were
searching for shelter, the smoker solemnly produced his
bundle and, gravely undoing the cover, unfolded and
donned a first-class waterproof coat which he had wisely
purchased in the capital. The astonishment visible on
their faces, and the look of triumph in which the
smoker indulged, were a study. The latter, notwithstanding
his misfortune, had more respect for his back
than his belly.</p>

<p>An immense plain, beautifully irrigated, stretches
north from Yang-lin; and, as we passed through it
northwards on the 2nd of June, it was teeming with
life. The numerous villages, nestling among trees
which dot the plain, had sent forth their able-bodied
men and women to pluck up the paddy shoots from the
nurseries, make them into bundles, and carry them
to the submerged rice-fields, where they were being
planted out in rows. Truly a happy, sunny picture.
Not cloudless, however; for what are those high upright
posts with balance beams near their tops, which
occur at somewhat regular intervals along the plain?
They are intended for suspending cages containing the
heads of highwaymen, who waylay travellers and traders
and rob and murder without mercy. Nor were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the cages all empty. Two ghastly heads adorned the
entrance to the village, which sheltered us at the end
of the first stage from Yang-lin.</p>

<p>In the northern part of the plain, which is stony
and unsuitable for rice and which ultimately merges in
the red-soiled uplands already so familiar in the west
of Kuei-chow and the east of Yün-nan, the potato was
growing abundantly between rows of withered poppy
stems. Yellow wheat and barley were being plucked
up by the roots, for not even the sickle was here in use.
Patches of buckwheat and oats completed the cultivation.
Much of the land, however, was covered with
wild grass, on which herds of swine, goats, sheep,
ponies, and oxen were feeding. The whole country,
from the immediate north of Yang-lin to the southern
edge of the large plain, wherein lies the prefectural city
of Tung-ch’uan Fu, may be described as a series of
valleys barred by red uplands, mountain ranges stretching
away to the west to the Yang-tsze and the home
of the Lolo. The road is frequently the bed of a
mountain torrent, which has to be crossed and re-crossed
many times a day.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>INSECURITY AND DISTRUST.</i></div>

<p>The people along the route seemed to entertain the
greatest distrust of us; small wonder, when robberies
are of such frequent occurrence. They even refused us
house-room for our meals, which had often to be spread
in the shade of a pine tree. At one village we borrowed
the public school-room, an act which, I fear,
gave a half-holiday to the scholars who, five in number,
divided their attention for a time between writing
their characters and watching the frolics of my dog.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
The master himself disappeared, and the scholars were
not slow to follow his example, each, however, preparatory
to leaving, carefully depositing his books, paper,
pens, and ink in his own basket hanging from a bamboo
partition in the room. A sixth basket was for the
discarded written characters.</p>

<p>It was just before entering this village that I was
witness of a curious superstition. We were caught in
a drizzle, and, as the shower clouds with a vivid rainbow
approached us, my followers covered their mouths
with their hats, fearful of the poisonous vapour which,
they said are given forth by rainbows. I laughed at
their superstition, and, as luck would have it, was
seized, a few hundred yards beyond, with a sudden fit
of vomiting. I received no sympathy, and my sickness
gave strength to their theory.</p>

<p>The city of Tung-ch’uan lies five miles from the
edge of the plain, down the west of which, through one
of the most fertile fields of Western China, flows the
I-li River on its way to join the Yang-tsze. The plain
was one mass of green tints, from the light green of the
paddy in the nurseries to the dark green of the more
matured shoots in the fields. The town, which is
nearly eight hundred feet above the Yün-nan Fu plain,
is not at all imposing, consisting, as it does, of one
main street; but the hills to the west impart to it its
reputation of being one of the wealthiest prefectures of
the province. They contain the most celebrated copper
mines in the Empire.</p>

<p>A French Father, who resided here, welcomed me as
if I had been a compatriot, and insisted on my spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>ing
the whole of the 8th of June in his company. He
had a regular battery of rifles and fowling pieces, and
turned out to be a keen sportsman. He had a stable
of two splendid ponies, on whose backs we spent nearly
the whole day careering through the Tung-ch’uan
plain. None but those who have spent years in solitude
in a strange land can realize what it is to meet a
fellow European. China was entirely forgotten in the
discussions of French and British politics, and it was
with the greatest difficulty that I could tear myself
away from his kind hospitality on the following morning.
All honour to men of surpassing ability who give
up their lives for heart-breaking work in China!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A SUCCESSFUL RUSE.</i></div>

<p>On entering the hills which bound the Tung-ch’uan
plain on the north, and which were almost devoid of
human habitations, we were overtaken by a rainstorm,
which continued throughout the day, and compelled us
to abandon the hope of reaching the end of the stage
that night. The road was soon reduced to a mass of
pulp, bordering yawning chasms, whose circumvention
by chairs was a source of difficulty and delay. The
roof of the room in which we huddled together, in the
wretched hamlet of Pan-pien-ch’ing, leaked at every
tile, and necessitated the erection of a tent with our
india-rubber sheeting. My troubles were only beginning,
however, for, the rain still continuing on the
following morning, my men refused to stir. My appeal
that they were daily nearing Ssŭ-ch’uan, and that they
had just rested a whole day in Tung-ch’uan, moved
them not; and, seeing that the limit of concessions for
their convenience had been reached, I took up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
small iron box containing my supply of silver, and,
calling my dog, set out alone. Plodding through a
shallow mountain torrent, which now occupied the
valley, I proceeded until I was out of sight of the
hamlet, when I sat down upon a rock to wait the issue
of events. The ruse was thoroughly successful; in half
an hour the whole caravan turned up in the sullenest
of tempers.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, our difficulties were just
beginning. The torrent was soon blocked by hills, its
waters obliterated the high-road, and we had to take to
the hills on the left before it could be regained. We
had not proceeded a mile, after a late breakfast, when
we found the road effectually cut off by a raging
torrent thirty yards in breadth and reaching above the
waist. A whole hour was wasted in trying to find a
shallow crossing, but in vain. The village of “Natural
Bridge” (what a mockery!) lay on the left bank, and
we called in eight of its most able-bodied to strip and
assist in carrying our chairs across.</p>

<p>The sensation of fording was not a pleasant one.
Twelve men with hands joined shouldered my chair,
which rocked about like a boat in a stormy sea, now up,
now down, as this or that man was washed off his feet.
One of my servant’s bearers was carried away for a
distance of thirty yards, and was ultimately rescued
more dead than alive by a cordon of men from the
opposite bank. Several strings of cash which he had
round his neck acted as an anchor to his head, and it
was only when they disappeared in the current that he
was able to regain his footing. Another who attempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to cross with the assistance of a pole had also to be
dragged ashore.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHINESE HOSPITALITY.</i></div>

<p>On a ridge five miles beyond is the hamlet of Liang-shui-ching,
which, as the name implies, is provided
with a splendid well of cold, clear water. Here the inhabitants
had turned the middle of the road into a
kitchen, where sundry messes were being cooked for
hungry wayfarers. Sitting round a stove, presided
over by a buxom young lady, my followers regained
their good humour in recounting the adventures of the
day; and, when a complaint was raised because salt
was not forthcoming, the beauty laughingly told them
that travellers by this route did not care for salt!</p>

<p>It is a trite but true saying, that misfortunes never
come singly. Owing to the numerous delays that had
occurred during the day, it was late in the afternoon
before we reached the hamlet of Shan-hu-shu, where,
notwithstanding its uninviting appearance, we found it
necessary to put up for the night. There was no inn,
and every room was already occupied by its legitimate
owners. The quest seemed hopeless when I stepped
into a mud hut of two rooms, one tenanted by a crowd
of natives, the other by a couple of cows and a pig.
After a considerable expenditure of argument and less
money, we induced the owners to remove and fraternize
with their cattle for the night, and hand over the byre
for our accommodation. The pig was the only one who
offered any serious objection; his gruntings over-night
and attacks on the intervening door somewhat disturbed
our slumbers, while sundry squeals told me that my
men found his familiarities too pronounced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Trade had now begun to assume formidable dimensions;
hundreds of ponies, mules, and donkeys, laden
with native cottons from the central provinces and salt
from Ssŭ-ch’uan, were daily hurrying southwards, while
P’u-êrh tea and lead kept us company. It was no great
surprise to us, when crossing the cultivated hills to
the north of Shan-hu-shu, to come upon carcases of
beasts of burden that had succumbed to the hardships
of the route. Strong as these little ponies are, there
comes a time when they are tried beyond their strength
by their merciless drivers, and fall down never to rise
again.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHAIN BRIDGE OVER THE NIU-LAN.</i></div>

<p>The delays that occurred during the first day north
of Tung-ch’uan, threw our marches into utter confusion;
instead of striking the Niu-lan River on the 11th June
and resting for the night on its left bank, we were compelled
by darkness to stop at the hamlet of Tu-kê-t’ang,
where I occupied an underground mud chamber,
certainly not an improvement on the byre of the previous
night. This was our consolation after a march of thirty
miles, begun at four o’clock in the morning and continued
till dark. Part of the road was exceedingly precipitous,
and had to be accomplished on all fours. Loud were
the lamentations of my followers when we attained the
ridge overlooking the Niu-lan River; the road zigzagged
down a deep precipitous valley strewn with huge
boulders, while opposite rose an equally steep range of
mountains, which had to be overcome during the day.
The Niu-lan rushed north-west, hurrying to the Yang-tsze
between two steep mountain ranges, which are
connected at the village of Chiang-ti, where we would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
fain have tarried for the day and gazed into the
roaring torrent from the windows of a promising inn,
by the chain bridge of “Eternal Peace.” Ten rows of
iron rods linked together are built into twenty yards of
solid masonry at either end of the bridge and into stone
piers, one distant twelve yards from the Chiang-ti, the
other twenty yards from the opposite shore, leaving a
central span of thirty-five yards. Planks placed on the
chains formed a roadway four yards in breadth, and
slight iron supports were suspended on either side from
a row of thick linked rods stretched over stone supports
erected on the piers. Thankful were we for the rest-houses
that dotted the opposite bank, which proved the
steepest and most difficult ascent we had yet encountered;
and grateful we were for the beverage
compounded of water and brown sugar exposed to allay
the thirst of weary wanderers. Talk of railways by
this route&mdash;as well talk of railways to the moon! Both
are equally feasible.</p>

<p>To compensate man and beast for their struggles on
the banks of the Niu-lan, a spring of deliciously cold
water gushes from the highest ridge that separates the
river from the Chao-t’ung plain. It rises out of an extensive
coal-field. Beyond the spring a glimpse of the
plain, with several sheets of water, is obtained, and
eagerly did we commence the descent, which is comparatively
easy. The city of Chao-t’ung Fu, which is
6580 feet above the level of the sea, lies nearly twenty
miles from the southern edge of the plain, which ultimately
stretches westward and is bounded eight miles
to the north of the city by low hills. Flourishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
villages dotted the plain, and the city itself showed
signs of being a great trade centre. Traffic was no
longer confined to man and beast, for the level ground
had called the cart into requisition. To reach the city
with greater despatch we engaged a number of small
skiffs and crossed a large lake&mdash;shallow, and, to judge
from dykes appearing here and there, occupying former
paddy land. These lakes are numerous, and well
stocked with fish.</p>

<p>The hills to the north of the plain are inhabited
chiefly by Lolos, who have not a very honourable reputation.
Stories of bloodshed and robbery committed by
them poured from the lips of the villagers who dwelt
by the roadside, and an idea that I entertained of
spending a day with this degenerate branch of the
tribe had to be abandoned. There would appear to be
some foundation for these roadside statements; villages,
and even single residences, were provided with watch-towers
and refuges, and ammunition in the shape of
stones was piled on the battlements to resist attacks.</p>

<p>The descent from the Chao-t’ung plain commences
in earnest thirty miles to the north of the city. In
company with a caravan, consisting of one hundred
ponies laden with P’u-êrh tea and tin, we zigzagged
in a dense fog down the northern face of the plateau,
over a stone road, rendered all but impassable by over-night
rain. In many places it skirts deep chasms, down
which mountain torrents were leaping and roaring. On
the edge of one of these a carrier narrowly escaped destruction;
he lost his footing, and was just in the act of
falling over with his load, when I succeeded in grasping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the end of his carrying pole and dragging him back to
the pathway.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CITY OF TA-KUAN T’ING.</i></div>

<p>On the afternoon of the 15th of June, we entered
the sub-prefectural city of Ta-kuan T’ing, which is
barely 3000 feet below the plateau. The tinkling of
many bells, issuing from the inns which we passed on
the way to our hostel, announced that several caravans
had already taken up their quarters for the night.
These bells are fixed in rows on broad leather straps,
which run over the necks and down the breasts of the
pack animals. In some caravans, only the leader is
provided with such a circlet. The head waters of the
Hêng River, which we had struck soon after our steep
descent, flow northwards to the west of the city; but,
the current being very rapid and the bed strewn with
boulders, navigation is out of the question. Another
descent of 2500 feet had to be made before boat traffic
commenced, the river meantime being considerably
augmented by an affluent from the west.</p>

<p>The road, which was execrable, follows the banks of
the river to the market-town of Lao-ya-t’an, or Lao-wa-t’an,
which lies on the right bank, and is the point
of junction of the two trade routes from Hsü-chou Fu,
in Ssŭ-ch’uan, to Yün-nan Fu, by way of the Hêng and
Nan-kuang Rivers, which enter the Yang-tsze, the one
to the west and the other to the east of the former
city, respectively. Lao-wa-t’an is entered over a fine
suspension bridge, the road following for about sixty
miles the left bank of the river through scenery of considerable
grandeur, resembling at some spots, though
on a less magnificent scale, the gorges of the mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
river it helps to swell. Four, instead of two, suspension
chains divide the bridge into a like number of
alley-ways, each of sufficient breadth to admit of the
passage of a single chair only. As the Grosvenor Mission
had followed the land route, by the banks of the
Hêng River from the Yang-tsze to Lao-wa-t’an, I resolved
to strike east, cross the Yün-nan-Ssŭ-ch’uan
frontier and descend the Nan-kuang River. Only one
range now lay between us and Ssŭ-ch’uan, and from the
summit we looked north-east on range after range of
mountains, which, happily for us, we had not to cross.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RETURN TO CH’UNG K’ING.</i></div>

<p>My men, who for the last few days had been unable
to procure rice, and had subsisted for the most part on
bean-curd, rejoiced to find themselves in a valley of
their own province where paddy, maize, tobacco, hemp,
and beans were well advanced, where silk was being
reeled and tea-plantations abounded. A streamlet flows
north-east down the valley, and following its course for
two days, we found ourselves on the 24th of June in
the village of Huang-shui-k’ou, where we soon engaged
a long empty cargo boat; and, shipping our whole caravan,
sped down the Nan-kuang River. On its upper
course it is confined by rocky hills, some eight hundred
feet in height, and little wooded, while huge boulders
coop up its waters and cause numerous rapids, down
which our craft, guided by stern and bow sweeps,
dashed four and five feet at a bound. In its lower
course the country opens out, and the boulders and
rapids disappear. A bed of rocks, over which the river
falls, obstructs navigation within a few hundred yards
of its mouth, and we landed on the 25th at the market<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
town of Nan-kuang on its left bank, whence the river
derives its name. Had my followers known how to
cheer they would have made the welkin ring, when,
just beyond Nan-kuang, the mighty Yang-tsze in full
flood burst upon us. For the present their work was
done; and, instead of carrying, they were now to be
carried back to their homes in Ch’ung-k’ing. Crossing
in boats to Hsü-chou Fu, which lies on the north bank
at the junction of the Chin-sha Chiang&mdash;the upper
waters of the Yang-tsze&mdash;and the Min river, we at
once proceeded to hire a large travelling boat, and at
1 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> the following day we were gliding eastwards to
Ch’ung-k’ing, which we reached on the evening of the
28th of June after an absence of sixty-eight days.</p>

capital of Ssŭ-ch’uan.</p></div>


<p>In February, 1883, I found myself at liberty to
carry out the resolution which I had made to visit Ta-li
Fu and the west of Yün-nan&mdash;all that remained for me
to do was to decide what route I should follow. Mr.
Baber’s admirable description of that part of Western
Ssŭ-ch’uan which he had explored, induced me to endeavour
to penetrate Yün-nan through the valley of
Chien-ch’ang, and accomplish the journey which Baron
von Richthofen had attempted, but, owing to an unfortunate
accident, had been compelled to relinquish. As
a preliminary to the execution of this scheme, it was
necessary to reach Chêng-tu, the capital of Ssŭ-ch’uan,
and the present chapter will be devoted to a description
of the products and industries of the country lying
between Ch’ung-k’ing and that city.</p>

<p>My caravan was, owing to the length of the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>posed
journey, somewhat larger than on the previous
expedition. There was one pack animal which, however,
succumbed to the hardships of the route.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FU-T’OU KUAN.</i></div>

<p>The small walled town of Fu-t’ou-kuan, some four
miles to the west of Ch’ung-k’ing, is perched on the
sandstone shoulders of the peninsula which divides the
Yang-tsze from its northern tributary, the Chia-ling.
Midway, and near the entrance to the village of Hsin-p’ai-fang,
is a large Mohammedan cemetery, sloping
towards the left bank of the Great River. In Ch’ung-k’ing,
the followers of the Prophet are reckoned by
thousands, and it is to their presence that the foreign
resident owes one or two of the daily luxuries&mdash;in more
civilized parts of the world they would be called the
necessities&mdash;of life. With the exception of a spacious
temple, erected in honour of the Goddess of Sericulture,
with extensive grounds crowded with mulberry trees,
just inside the west gate, Fu-t’ou-kuan has little to
boast of in the way of architecture; but outside the
gate a number of fine memorial stone portals arch the
roadway, which is also edged at short intervals with
stone tablets recounting the virtues of deceased officials,
and acts of filial affection.</p>

<p>To the west of Fu-t’ou-kuan the country is somewhat
broken; low hills alternate with plains dotted
with farm-houses, nestling amid clumps of bamboo&mdash;a
proof that here at least there is security for life and
property. Nor are villages and market-towns wanting.
The latter frequently vie with walled cities in commercial
importance. In the plains, wheat, beans, rape,
poppy, and peas were growing luxuriantly, while many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
plots of paddy land were submerged in preparation for
the summer sowing. The hill-sides were also covered
with beans, which seem to thrive well on a scanty soil.
The low, umbrageous wood-oil tree was likewise scattered
thickly on the rocky ground. Beneath the huge,
dark-green, spreading banyans by the road-side, houses
and restaurants spring, mushroom-like, and invite the
traveller to tarry for a moment and enjoy their cool
shade. As pack animals are usually turned loose to forage
for themselves, the peasantry, whose lands adjoin
the high-road, have hit upon a novel plan to prevent
their depredations. Wheat and beans were thickly
sprinkled with feathers, which, as might naturally be
supposed, are not a pleasant sauce.</p>

<p>For some days at the Chinese New Year, business
of every description comes to an absolute stand-still;
houses and shops are shut, and in semi-darkness the
inmates eat, drink, and make merry. As we started
from Ch’ung-k’ing on the fourth day of the first moon
(February 11th), we found that the people were still
bent on pleasure, and that dice and theatrical performances
were dividing the attention of those who had
escaped from their New Year’s imprisonment.</p>

<p>Although coal is found in abundance near the district
city of Yung-ch’uan&mdash;some sixty miles to the
south-west of Ch’ung-k’ing&mdash;I noticed in the streets
large quantities of charcoal, prepared from the stems of
bracken. These are placed in a pit and covered over,
so as to prevent blazing after ignition.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHINESE CLOTH MAKERS.</i></div>

<p>The district city of Jung-ch’ang Hsien lies on the
left bank of a tributary of the T’o River, which enters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the Yang-tsze at the city of Lu Chou. It is distant
forty miles west by north from Yung-ch’uan, and is
approached through the same broken hilly country. It
is famous for its breed of pigs, and is noted as a centre
for the manufacture of fans and grass-cloth. The bamboos,
of which the framework of the fans is made, are
carefully cultivated along the banks of the river, while
the cloth is manufactured from Ramie fibre, <i>Boehmeria
nivea</i>, grown extensively in the district. The Chinese,
unlike the home manufacturers, have not yet been inflamed
with the desire to possess machinery capable of
separating the fibre, and at the same time preserving
the silky gloss which adds so much to the beauty and
value of the cloth. Here it is entirely hand labour.
The stems are cut down in the fields and carried home
for manipulation. The skin or bark is first removed
from the stems by hand and the branches and leaves
from the bark, which is steeped for a few minutes in
water. The strips are then taken one by one by the
operator, who is provided with a thick broad iron
thumb ring on which a short blunt blade is fixed and
a curved knife equally blunt, and passed rapidly between
the two blades, which are held in the left hand.
By this means the green or outer bark is removed and
the inner white fibre remains. The latter is afterwards
handed over to women, who shred and twist it into
thread ready for weaving.</p>

<p>The process of removing the bark from the stem has
reached a higher state of development in the seaboard
provinces, and merits the attention of cultivators in
other countries. In the province of Chê-kiang, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
I am now writing, decortication is effected in the field.
The workman grasps the plant between the finger and
thumb of his left hand, about six inches above the
ground, and drawing it slightly towards him, seizes it
two inches or more higher up, between the thumb and
forefinger of his right hand. A smart forward push
with the right at once causes a compound fracture of
the stem; the forefinger of the right hand is inserted
at the point of fracture and drawn up to the top of the
plant, separating the bark on the left from the bark and
broken stem on the right; the bark on the left is then
drawn down and is easily detached at the root, the
bark and stem on the right being treated in the same
manner. The stem is removed with ease, and the
branches and leaves give way when the strips of bark
are passed through the right hand. By this means a
much longer fibre is obtained, and the branches and
leaves remain on the field to assist in manuring the
second and third crops. Care must be taken not to
twist the plant in giving the forward push; I spoiled
at least a dozen stems before I succeeded in causing
the necessary compound fracture. In Chê-kiang, a flat
piece of wood takes the place of the blade on the thumb-ring,
and the curved knife is supplanted by an instrument
resembling a shoe-horn made of iron. The cloth,
after it leaves the loom, has to undergo a considerable
amount of bleaching, before it attains the beautiful
white colour which it presents in the piece. It is of
various qualities, and ranges from one pound to two
shillings and sixpence per piece of forty-six Chinese
feet long and eighteen inches broad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of crossing the handsome stone bridge of
seven arches, the “Lion’s Bridge,” which spans the river
to the west of the city, we took boat and dropped westward
with the stream for a distance of five miles. The
river frequently expands to a breadth of one hundred
yards; but even in the short space it bore us, rocks
project into it at two places from the left and right
bank respectively, leaving only a very narrow channel
just sufficient for one of these small boats to pass. A
little above our landing place on the right bank, a
stone bridge of thirty-eight arches runs across the river,
rocks showing everywhere. The arches are very low&mdash;only
one is available for boat traffic&mdash;and we slipped
through with very little to spare between the roof of
the arch and the tops of our chairs. Excellent coal in
large quantities was being carried up river to Jung-ch’ang.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CITY OF LUNG-CH’ANG.</i></div>

<p>On the afternoon of the 15th of February we entered
the city of Lung-ch’ang, which presented a picture
of business both outside and inside its walls. It is also
famed for its grass-cloth. It lies in the centre of a carboniferous
region, about a hundred mines existing in
the neighbourhood. Many of them, however, have
suffered that fate which attaches to most mining industries
in China: they have been flooded, and the workmen
are not supplied with the necessary appliances
called pumps.</p>

<p>The immense salt traffic, which we met going east,
tempted us to leave the main road to the capital and
pay a visit to the celebrated salt wells of Tzŭ-liu-ching,
farther west. Two stages lay between us and the wells,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and we spent the first night on the left bank of the T’o
River, probably the busiest stream of its size in Western
China. Rising to the north-east of the provincial
capital, it flows through the great sugar region of the
province, and to the south of the district city of Fu-shun
it is joined by a tributary which connects it with
the salt wells. In return for its salt and sugar, it absorbs
enormous quantities of raw cotton and cotton
cloth, so that there is one continuous stream of traffic
on its waters. The sugar factories to the west of the
river were indeed merry; the din that came from them
resembled very much the music from an iron foundry,
only louder.</p>

<p>On the following day we struck the left bank of the
tributary, took boat for a short distance, and again
landed on the left bank before ascending the low hill,
on the slope of which the town of Tzŭ-liu-ching is
built.</p>

<p>This great salt belt stretches west to the left bank
of the Min River and south towards the Yang-tsze.
In the Shê-hung district, a hundred miles to the north-west,
salt beds are also found and worked; but it is
from the former that the greater parts of the provinces
of Ssŭ-ch’uan, Kuei-chow, and the north-east of Yün-nan
are supplied. I spent a whole day in visiting the
larger wells, which are situated inside the town, and a
short description of one of the greatest industries of
Western China cannot fail to be of some interest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SALT WELLS.</i></div>

<p>When I had prevailed on the immense crowd that
accompanied me on my round of sight-seeing, to leave
an open space, so that I might be observed to greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
advantage, and that I might catch a glimpse of what I
had come so far to see, I found myself seated&mdash;a settle
had been procured for me&mdash;beside a square stone embedded
in the ground, with a central hole a few inches
in diameter. From the hole there was issuing a hempen
rope, about an inch thick, which, ascending, passed over
a movable wheel fixed at the top of a staging some
sixty feet high and bearing a striking resemblance to
the shears at a dockyard. On leaving the shears, the
rope descended and passed under another wheel fixed
a few feet above ground, whence for the moment it
escaped from our range of vision. After the lapse of a
quarter of an hour, the top of a tube, from nine to ten
inches in circumference, attached to the rope, made its
appearance and was drawn up to within a foot of the
wheel. Meantime a workman, stationed at the mouth
of the wheel, had thrown a rope round the tube, which
was composed of the stems of a number of bamboos fixed
together, and, immediately the lower end appeared, he
drew it to one side and over a wooden reservoir built
into the ground. Embracing the tube with his left
arm, he plunged an iron rod which he held in his right
hand into the bottom, and raising a leather valve,
which was there adjusted, allowed the contents, consisting
of black, dirty-looking water, to escape into the
reservoir. This was the brine. The tube was again
placed over the well, and descended with great rapidity.
Whence the motive power that raised the brine? Following
the rope after it left the second wheel, I found
that it entered a large shed, the floor of which was
several feet underground. In the centre of the building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
was an enormous bamboo wheel or drum, twelve feet in
height and sixty in circumference, placed on a vertical
axis, to which the rope was attached six feet from the
ground. As I entered, four huge water-buffaloes were
being harnessed, at equal distances, to the circumference
of the drum; each buffalo had a driver, whose duty it
seemed to be to belabour the animal with a short, stout
hempen rope to induce it to break into a trot. As the
drum revolved, the rope coiled round it at a sufficient
height not to impede the buffaloes. For a quarter of
an hour, that is, until the tube had been again raised,
this unmerciful beating went on, when the poor beasts,
exhausted and white with froth, were unharnessed and
led back to their stable, whence a fresh relay was
brought. When the animals were unharnessed and the
signal given, the drum reversed with great velocity,
creating a violent wind all round. Forty animals were
employed at this well, and each relay raised the brine
about ten times every twenty-four hours. They are
specially selected for the work, and cost from forty to
fifty taels apiece. The specimens I saw were fat and
in excellent condition; but, although they are carefully
fed and attended to&mdash;each costing three hundred cash
a day&mdash;their staying power does not exceed five years.
Many even fail within the first year; nor is this to be
wondered at, for the make of the animal fits it for a
slow plodding life only.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PROCESS OF EVAPORATION.</i></div>

<p>Retracing my steps to the large reservoir by the
well, I found that the brine was being carried off in
bamboo pipes laid down between it and smaller wooden
reservoirs in the evaporating sheds, which I next visited.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
On the floors of the latter, rows of brick furnaces with
round openings at the tops were built. On each furnace
rested a round, shallow, iron pan, about four feet
in diameter, filled with brine conducted in open bamboo
pipes from the reservoirs, which occupy one side of each
shed. Where was the fuel? Under each pan was
a flame blazing from a bamboo tube coated with lime
and fitted with an iron burner, while all round flames
burst from smaller upright tubes and lighted the sheds,
for there is no cessation, night or day, in the work of
evaporation. I was next conducted to the “fire-well”
whence the fuel is procured. It was quite close to the
brine well, and was carefully built over, bamboo tubes
covered with lime to prevent escape ramifying from
the cap covering the mouth to the evaporating sheds.
There can be little doubt that the “fire wells,” which
are nearly all situated within the town, contain petroleum
from which the vapour or gas arising supplies the
natural fuel. They have, however, never been worked
for the oil. The stench which permeates the whole
town reminds one forcibly of a gasworks, but the gas
has not, as in some parts of Ohio, been utilized to light
the streets. All the wells, which are worked by
private companies, are now under Government control,
and there is an office established at Tzŭ-liu-ching
through which all salt transactions are carried on. The
actual cost price of the salt is thirteen to fourteen cash
a catty, but the Government manages to extract from
buyers twenty-two to twenty-three cash.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE WORKING OF THE SALT WELLS.</i></div>

<p>The salt is of two kinds&mdash;pan or lump, and granular
salt. The former is from two to three inches in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
thickness, and is of the same shape and size as the
evaporating pans. In preparing the latter, bean flour
is used to give it a whiter appearance. The work of
evaporation occupies from two to five days, according
to the strength of the gas-flame. As the salt wells
number over a thousand, and the “fire wells” only
about a score, much of the brine is carried into the
town for evaporation. Pans are leased by the year,
the privilege costing about forty taels each. A contractor
supplies the pans, which weigh 1600 lbs. apiece,
for from thirty to forty taels a year each&mdash;the old pans,
which are changed about once a fortnight, being the
property of the contractor. Brine is found at depths
varying from 700 to over 2000 feet, and from a dirty
yellow in the shallower, becomes a deep black in the
deepest wells. Twice as much salt is evaporated from
the black as from the yellow brine&mdash;the deeper the
well the stronger the solution. As the region in which
the wells are situated is of sandstone formation, the
difficulties of boring to these great depths, even with
primitive machinery, are not very great. A bamboo
lever is erected over the spot where the operations are
to be carried on; an iron jumper over one hundred
pounds in weight is attached by a bamboo rope to the
thin end of the lever; on both sides of the thicker
end, scaffoldings with plankways are built; several men
jump simultaneously from the planking on one side to
the planking on the other, using the lever as a stepping
stone; and the jumper is raised, released, and
falls crushing the stone, a rotary motion being imparted
to the weight by a man who stands by the mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of the well, and twists the bamboo rope as the lever
is about to drop. The rope is lengthened as required
by adding strips of split bamboo. I have heard doubts
expressed as to the depths of these wells; but the
figures given are unimpeachable. The well which I
visited was over 2000 feet in depth, and I arrived at
this result by a very simple calculation. The drum
was sixty feet in circumference, and thirty-four coils
of rope were wound up before the tube reached the
mouth of the well. In boring in the vicinity of the
town, at least, it is impossible to predict whether petroleum
or brine will be struck; but as both are valuable,
the result is always satisfactory.</p>

<p>The workmen presented a very worn and unhealthy
appearance, and, to judge from the alarming number of
beggars in the town, life at the wells must be very
trying and short. Their wages range from 1200 to
1300 cash per month, with board&mdash;not a large sum for
labour amid noxious gases which permeate the whole
place.</p>

<p>The history of this great industry is lost in antiquity;
but salt is said to have been worked at Tzŭ-liu-ching
as early as the Minor Han Dynasty, which
was established in Ssŭ-ch’uan, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 221-263.</p>

<p>We had found the inns on the main road comparatively
comfortable; on the branch road to Tzŭ-liu-ching
we were confronted with wretched dens specially intended
for the accommodation of salt carriers. A bed-room
is easily described. A trestle framework, two feet
high, ran the length of the narrow cell; on the top
was spread a straw mattress, an inch and a half thick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
covered with a rush mat. During the day the bedding,
which consisted of a long bag padded with cotton, was
stowed in the office, and was not issued till payment of
the few cash necessary to ensure a night’s lodging.</p>

<p>Daylight of the 19th of February found us marching
northwards to regain the high-road to the provincial
capital. On leaving the salt area the road winds round
low hills terraced and cultivated, each terrace rising
above the other and faced by a wall of dark, bare sandstone.
So much did they resemble circular forts, that
one felt inclined to look for the embrasures and guns.
These rocks were, however, fast crumbling into soil,
their colour being easily distinguishable in the adjacent
fields amid the beans and peas springing up from the
old cane-brakes, and the rape and wheat which occupied
the rest of the arable land. Farther north the yellow
soil showed that hills had been entirely disintegrated
by the weather, assisted by the hoe. In other places
the hills were partly clad with stunted pines, while
clumps of bamboo and an occasional pumelo and banyan
were to be seen. The poppy was not at all prominent&mdash;it
prefers a heavier soil than sandstone. The 20th
of February broke dull, and by noon, when we struck
the right bank of the T’o River, opposite the city of
Tzŭ Chou, the day had fairly broken down; and on a
vote being taken whether we should proceed or spend
the afternoon and night within the walls, my followers
to a man&mdash;just as I expected&mdash;preferred the latter
course. The river was of no great depth: a bamboo
proved sufficient to guide the movements of the small
boats in which we were ferried across.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SUGAR AND SAFFLOWER.</i></div>

<p>Tzŭ Chou is an inviting city; it possesses broad
streets of large, prosperous-looking shops, and its numerous
blue-brick houses give it an air of substantiality.
The district in which it is situated is a great producer of
sugar; while the soil, being light and sandy, is likewise
favourable to the growth of the ground-nut, <i>Arachis
hypogæa L.</i>, whence a sweet cooking-oil is extracted.
Coal is also found in the immediate hills. The distance
from this city to the provincial capital is reckoned as
four stages; but, although we succeeded in accomplishing
the first without mishap, rain and snow compelled
us to distribute the remainder over four days. Beyond
the weather, no other difficulty presented itself. The
sandstone country extends a little to the north of the
district city of Tz’ŭ-yang Hsien, which, like Tzŭ Chou,
stands on the right bank of the T’o River, whose course
the high-road follows in the main. Bare, red hills then
put in an appearance, and cultivation, except at their
bases, stops. This belt of hills extends for twenty-five
miles, when it gives place to a long, wide plain&mdash;the
plain of Chien Chou&mdash;famous for its opium. It is interesting
to watch the effect which one foreign industry
has had on this remote spot. Previous to the introduction
of aniline dyes into China, the department of
Chien Chou was widely famed for its safflower, <i>Carthamus
tinctorius L.</i>, which, with that grown within the
Shun-ching prefecture, not only sufficed to meet the
wants of the province, but was annually sent eastward
in large quantities. All is now changed. Safflower has
been supplanted by “Pure Soluble Scarlet” in bottle,
and the plain of Chien Chou has been converted into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
poppy garden. The plant is still cultivated, but in
very small quantities and almost entirely for local use.
The plain, which was dotted with farm-houses and
homesteads peeping out from bamboos and cypresses,
runs due north and south. In the north lies the city
of Chien Chou, the approach to which is marked by
three pagodas, one of them thirteen storeys high. It
occupies the right bank of the river, which is joined to
the immediate north of the city by a tributary from the
west. Crossing the latter by a five-arched stone bridge,
we followed the main river through orange groves and
copses of bamboo and cypress, which would have met
with admiration but for a low thermometer, a piercing
north wind, and a drenching rain. A few salt wells to
the north of the city were being worked, charcoal being
the fuel used in evaporation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A STARTLING CONTRAST.</i></div>

<p>Leaving the river we struck west by north through
the belt of low hills which separates the Chien Chou
and Ch’êng-tu plains. These hills are rocky and little
cultivated, the thin poor soil not holding out that inducement
which even a Chinese expects for his labour.
Snow was falling thickly when we reached the rim of
the immense plain&mdash;the plain <i>par excellence</i> of the province
of Ssŭ-ch’uan&mdash;and the imperfect glimpses which
we caught through the snow-flakes revealed flooded
paddy-fields and the ordinary winter crops, the most
prominent of which was the poppy. Over fifteen miles
still separated us from the eastern wall of the city, but
we were fated, before reaching this centre of wealth
and luxury, to be reminded that riches and poverty
always go hand in hand. Under a memorial archway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
near the entrance of one of the market-towns in the
plain, lay a beggar stark and stiff. The yard of matting,
which was the only clothing he possessed and
which covered his loins, had proved insufficient to
ward off the chill hand of death. A few yards off sat
some companions, listless shivering wretches, with faces
pinched and worn, outcasts from their kind. Hundreds
of beggars crowded the eastern suburb of the city, and
it was with difficulty that we pushed our way through
the mass of rags and dirt that held the bridge, which
spans the stream flowing southwards under the eastern
wall. They seemed to have just returned from the
public soup-kitchens, which open in the large towns of
China during winter, and dole out to the most necessitous
enough to keep them from actual starvation.
We had no sooner settled down in a comfortless inn
than the underlings of the various officials came to prey
upon us. They came laden with offers of assistance;
they departed, each with a handful of cash, satisfied
that they had done their duty. We saw none of them
again&mdash;the key to peace and quietude was cheap at the
price.</p>

<p>Ch’êng-tu, the capital of the largest and probably
the richest province in the Empire, is a splendid city,
fifteen hundred feet above the level of the sea, enclosed
by an excellent wall about twelve miles in circumference.
It is the seat of a Viceroy, or Governor-General,
whose jurisdiction extends over the one province
only. With the exception of Chihli, it is the
only province in China which is thus honoured. Of
the other sixteen, each is entrusted to the care of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Governor; but with the exception of Shantung, which
has no superintending Viceroy, and of the three Provinces
of Kiangsu, Kiangsé, and Anhui, which are
under one Viceroy, they are divided into groups
of two, with a Viceroy over each group. The city
is divided into two parts, the quarter occupied
by the Tartar garrison and their families, and the
Chinese or commercial quarter. It is without exception
the finest city I have seen in China; Peking
and Canton will not bear comparison with it. The
streets in the Chinese quarter are fairly broad, paved
with stone, and slope gently to either side. They were
clean and in excellent repair. During my two days’
sojourn I traversed many of the streets, and, notwithstanding
the fact that it rained heavily the whole time,
they were crowded with moving masses of bustling,
gaily-dressed, well-to-do people. Chairs with their
passengers and ponies with their riders were everywhere
on the move. But the prettiest sight of all was the
signboards. The reader must bear in mind that these
are not placed horizontally over the shop doors as in
Europe; they hang vertically from iron bars projecting
from the walls. In Ch’êng-tu they are one mass of gold
and colour, decorating the streets and proclaiming, at
the same time, the names of the shops&mdash;not the names
of the owners&mdash;and the wares on sale. It may be that
the unfortunate weather prevented me from seeing
anything prepossessing or attractive in the Tartar
quarter. Here the streets were broad, unpaved, and
muddy; the people, especially the women, were badly,
even slovenly, dressed; everything announced the pres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>ence
of parasites battening on Government pay, without
affording any adequate return. Much of the land in
this quarter, which is thickly wooded, is devoted to
gardens; but I should question whether these slip-shod,
down-at-heel, lazy-looking Tartars possessed the energy
to grow sufficient vegetables to supplement their government
rice.</p>

<p>Ch’êng-tu derives considerable importance from being
the meeting point of the great high-roads from the
Eastern and Northern provinces, from Yün-nan and
Tibet, and it is undoubtedly the place whence the latter
may most easily be entered from the Chinese side.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A FRESH START MEDITATED.</i></div>

<p>My aim was now to reach Ta-li Fu, in Western
Yün-nan, by way of Ya-chou Fu, the valley of Chien-ch’ang
or Ning-yuan, and Yung-pei T’ing. In undertaking
a long and arduous journey such as this, it might
have been more advisable to take boat to Chia-ting on
the Min River, or even as far as Ch’êng-tu, and then
start afresh; but in that case I would have missed one
of the most interesting sights and industries of the
province&mdash;the salt wells of Tzŭ-liu-ching. My men
grumbled loudly because I declined to stay longer than
two days in Ch’êng-tu. Finding, however, that I was
inexorable, they gave in, and on the morning of the
28th of February, we were all ready to penetrate the
wilds and backwoods of Western China.</p>

<p>Leaving the city by the south gate and crossing
the bridge which spans the river flowing under the
wall, we proceeded south-west through the great plain
of Ch’êng-tu. Here there is a perfect network of limpid
streams and irrigating canals rushing swiftly southwards,
and fitted with sluices to ensure the flooding of
the plots which in summer and autumn form one vast
rice-field. As might be expected, this water-power is
not allowed to run to waste; tiny mills for hulling rice
and grinding wheat were to be seen on the banks of
many of the streamlets. Clumps of bamboo and plantations
of fir encircled the farm-houses, and a tree called
by the Chinese <i>ching-mu</i>&mdash;probably a species of beech&mdash;grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
extensively along the narrow waterways. It
is a tree of rapid growth; it is allowed three years to
develop, when it is cut down for firewood and supplanted
by a young sapling. The primitive Chinese
barrow was much in use in the plain for passenger and
other traffic, nor was the squeaking of the wheel absent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A CAGED CRIMINAL.</i></div>

<p>To the south of the small district city of Shuang-liu,
we met a party of Tibetans clad in their long, reddish,
woollen gowns. They were on foot, but each
was leading his pony by the bridle. A few hundred
yards behind them was a large, wooden, barred cage,
slung on a couple of carrying-poles supported by a pair
of bearers. In the chair sat an individual heavily
chained, and clothed in even a more pronounced red
than his guards. Although I was unable to get at the
details of the case, beyond the apparent fact that the
gentleman in irons was a criminal being escorted to
Ch’êng-tu, yet the method of conveyance told me that
he was a criminal of no ordinary type.</p>

<p>Cotton spinning and weaving and the manufacture
of looms and iron pans were the chief industries of the
plain. At many of the country villages the raw cotton,
which comes by water from the central provinces,
was being handed to the women, who brought in exchange
yarn and cotton cloth of their own spinning
and weaving.</p>

<p>Before entering the district city of Hsin-ching,
which lies about fifteen miles south by west of Shuang-liu,
we had to cross three branches of a river, a tributary
of the Min, by wooden bridges of somewhat novel
construction. Stones in bamboo baskets were piled on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
both banks of the river, and on these the ends of the
bridges rested. On the stages supporting the floors,
similar baskets of stones were suspended, to keep them
from being washed away by the rapid current. Pigs’
bristles, which, the western farmer will be somewhat
surprised to learn, are highly prized as manure, formed
an important item of the trade seen on the plain.</p>

<p>From Hsin-ching the road runs west over a fine
level tract of country as far as the city of Chiung Chou.
I must confess that I felt considerable anxiety in approaching
this place. Baron von Richthofen has drawn
a very dark picture of it. He says:&mdash;“All the men
are armed with long knives and use them frequently in
their rows. I have passed few cities in China in which
I have suffered so much molestation from the people
as I did there; and travellers should avoid making
night quarters there, as it was my lot to do. The city
is large and overcrowded with people. They are
badly dressed, and have repulsive features.”</p>

<p>It was with the view of ascertaining whether the
morals of the people of Chiung Chou had improved
since the Baron’s visit, and to impress upon the inhabitants,
if necessary, the words of their sage Confucius,
who preached “How pleasant a thing it is to be able to
attract strangers from afar,” that I resolved to spend
the night of the 1st of March within the walls. I was
quite prepared to be greeted by a population of armed
ruffians; but, more fortunate than the Baron, I was
agreeably disappointed. The people were not more
curious than in other towns; and, as for knives, I failed
to see any except in the hands of innocent-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
butchers. My writer, however, declared that he saw
one young fellow with a knife, but he explained that
only the young blades carry such dangerous weapons.
I did not observe any one particularly well dressed or
good looking, nor, on the other hand, did I see any one
with repulsive features. There were beggars and dirt
as a matter of course. What I did specially notice, however,
was that the place had a very sleepy atmosphere;
the whole street of shops, which strikes the main street
at right angles and leads to the south gate, remained
closed as we left the city early next morning.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CELESTIAL MEDICINES.</i></div>

<p>Chiung Chou lies on the south-western edge of the
Ch’êng-tu plain. A fine stone bridge of fifteen arches
spans the river&mdash;the Nan Ho&mdash;which flows eastwards
to the south of the city. It is two hundred and fifty
yards long and twenty-four feet broad; at either end
there is a stone archway, and on the centre stands a
pavilion, whence we caught a glimpse of snow-clad
mountains to the west. The piers of the bridge are
heavily buttressed. To the south of the river low uplands,
well covered with pine, succeed the plain, and
stretch with two breaks of valleys, wherein lie the
market-town of Pai-chang-ch’ang, or Pai-chang-yi, and
the district city of Ming-shan, respectively, as far as
the left bank of the Ya Ho. In the Pai-chang valley
a stream flows north-east to join a larger affluent of the
Min River. Here we met a number of carriers with
medicines from Yün-nan. The Chinese pharmacopœia
is very comprehensive; tigers’ bones and deer’s horns
are well-known celestial remedies, but dried armadillo
skins as a drug had hitherto escaped our ken. Bundles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of rush wicks&mdash;the pith of the <i>Juncus effusus L.</i>&mdash;were
also going north in large quantities from the Ming-shan
district. The road west of Ch’êng-tu was for the
most part unpaved, but to the south of Chiung Chou
boulders from the bed of the Nan Ho were laid in glorious
disorder on the pathway. Even for the Chinese
straw sandal they proved impracticable, and one of my
bearers slipped and fell forward on his carrying pole, one
of the brass spikes of which pierced his temple. Now,
thought I, had the time arrived to display my store of
foreign medicines, and I was looking forward to the
effect which an application of Friar’s Balsam would
have on the patient and his comrades, when there was
a sudden call for tobacco. My pleadings to be allowed
to treat the case were in vain&mdash;a handful of cut tobacco
was placed over the wound, and all the assistance I
was permitted to give was the loan of my handkerchief
to bind the head and keep the narcotic in position.</p>

<p>From the low, rising ground to the west of Pai-chang-ch’ang
we obtained a good view of the country
beyond; dark hills with a snow-clad range in their rear
lay before us. The white foamy crest of a huge billow
breaking on a darker sea would fairly represent the picture.
The Chin-chi pass, two thousand feet above the
sea, divides the valley in which Ming-shan is situated
from the valley of the Ya Ho. The cultivated terraces
on the hill sides which bound the latter were built up
with rounded stones and baskets of shingle lying by
the left bank indicated that the valley is liable to inundation.
We struck the river, which flows east, five
miles from Ya-chou Fu, the city on the right bank from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
which it derives its name. Crossing a tributary by a
wooden bridge of seven arches, we were soon face to
face with the main river, which we passed over by a
floating bridge, the first of its kind I had seen in China.
High cones of stones in baskets were piled on both
banks, and round these a huge cable of woven split
bamboo was wound; bundles of bamboos firmly tied
together, about a foot apart, floated on the surface of the
water, each bundle being securely fastened to the cable
at its up-river end; planks were spread on the bundles
to form a roadway; and rails of bamboo ran along both
sides of the plankway. The city, which is picturesquely
situated on rising ground, has broad streets and possessed,
what was indeed a luxury to us, a good inn.
It was altogether too tempting, and I determined to
take a day’s rest, and make some enquiries as to the
trade in brick tea, of which it is the centre.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BRICK TEA FOR TIBET.</i></div>

<p>Within and on the borders of the prefecture of Ya-chou,
all the brick tea sent to Tibet is prepared. The
tea-growing districts, in their order of production, are
Jung-ching, Ya-an, and Ti’en-ch’üan Chou. Chiung
Chou produces least. On the Mêng-shan Hills, which
lie within the Ming-shan district, a tea is grown exclusively
for use in the Imperial Palace, and is brought to
Ya-chou for transmission to Peking. The estimated
total value of the tea grown within the prefecture is
one million taels, while the duties collected were given
as forty thousand taels. The best tea is picked by hand
in the second moon; the coarse tea is picked, or rather
cut&mdash;a knife is used for the purpose&mdash;during the third
moon, when leaves and twigs are indiscriminately col<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>lected.
The growers sell to the tea hongs, fine leaf at
from four to five taels per picul (133⅓ lbs.), coarse leaf
at about 1·8 taels for the same quantity. Three qualities
of tea are prepared, known respectively as “Ku
yü,” “Mao chien,” and “Sui fang,” the selling price
being two, one and a half, and one mace per catty.
The leaf is steamed, and made up into long, narrow, flat
packages, having an inner casing of banana leaf, and an
outer casing of matting. A package of the finer tea
weighs eighteen catties, or twenty-four pounds, while a
package of the coarser tea frequently weighs only ten
catties, or thirteen and a third pounds. The standard
of sale at Ya-chou is the sum of fifty taels, the number
of packages that can be bought for this sum varying
according to the state of the market.</p>

<p>The total value of the tea trade with Tibet amounts
in round numbers to between £150,000 and £200,000.
All this tea is carried on the backs of porters, piled on
a wooden framework which curves forward over the
head, and is thus conveyed from Ya-chou to the town
of Ta-chien-lu, near the Tibetan frontier, the journey
usually occupying fifteen days. The number of packages
in a load varies, of course, according to the quality
of the tea. I have counted as many as fourteen packages,
but the average load contained from eight to
nine. The freight per package between the two places
was said to be three hundred cash, but as loads varied
as to the number of packages or bricks, and the bricks
themselves as to weight, there must be some more
satisfactory method of calculation in making payment.
Like the salt carriers in Kuei-chow, these porters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
whom we counted by hundreds daily to the south of
Ya-chou, were wanting in leg, nothing beyond an
ordinary development being observable. During their
arduous mountain journey they rest frequently and
long.</p>

<p>This tea differs altogether from the brick tea prepared
in the Russian tea hongs at Hankow. The latter
is manufactured from the dust and broken leaf of fine
teas into hard, solid bricks, or into thin, ridged cakes,
an infusion of which is exceedingly palatable. The
Tibetans, on the other hand, eat the leaves churned up
with butter, not even a twig being lost.</p>

<p>But the products of the prefecture are not confined
to tea; two varieties of drugs are largely exported.
They are called <i>Hou p’o</i> and <i>Huang lien</i>. The former
is the bark of <i>Magnolia hypoleuca, S. et Z</i>, and the
latter consists of the rhizomes of <i>Coptis teeta Wall</i>.
The bark of the wild Magnolia being thicker, is preferred
to the bark of the cultivated tree and fetches a
much higher price. Coal and iron are also mined and
worked.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE FLYING DRAGON PASS.</i></div>

<p>We spent the greater part of the 5th of March
struggling in a dense mist along the right bank of a
small tributary of the Ya Ho. A pass, called the
“Flying Dragon,” 3580 feet above the sea, lies between
this and a larger tributary of the same river. A long
pull over a frightful road brought us to the summit,
where we sat down and made friends with a number of
Tibetans of both sexes, who were engaged in a pilgrimage
to the sacred mountains of Western China. The
women were sturdy and good-looking, gaily ornamented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
with ear-rings and brooches, and had none of that lifelessness
and insipidity which characterize their almond-eyed
sisters. No mock-modesty debarred them from
chaffing and laughing at my European features and
dress. Up the west side of the pass scrambled about
twenty ponies and mules, panting and blowing; not
without sufficient cause, for they were carrying heavy
loads of copper from Ning-yuan, and, from Yün-nan,
the bark of a species of <i>Rhamnus</i>, which is used for
making a green dye.</p>

<p>Are the Chinese wanting in the faculty of invention?
It is well known that they will make an exact copy of
any pattern that may be supplied to them. A tailor
has been known to produce a new coat duly patched to
match the exemplar; but the ability of the race to give
an original idea to the world has been hotly disputed.
I think the water-wheels of Kuei-chow, which I have
described in a previous chapter, are novel and ingenious,
and south of Ya-chou I saw the water-wheel turned to
two skilful and, at the same time, practical uses. A
part of the horizontal axle of the wheel was removed,
and an iron elbow inserted; to the elbow a long iron
rod was attached by an eye; to the lower end of the
rod was fixed a polisher, which, as the wheel revolved,
was drawn backwards and forwards over the surface of
a stone pillar being prepared for building purposes. On
exactly the same principle, except that the axle of the
wheel was vertical instead of horizontal, the rod was
made to blow a blacksmith’s bellows.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TRUTH AT A DISCOUNT.</i></div>

<p>Descending from the pass, we took up our head-quarters
for the night on the right bank of the Jung-ching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
River, as this tributary of the Ya Ho is called.
Great excitement now began to manifest itself among
my followers. We were only a day’s journey from the
foot of the Ta Hsiang Ling Pass, and carriers from Yün-nan,
who came to our inn, were cramming them with
the difficulties that had to be surmounted. Snow, so
they said, was lying deep on the passes, and they had
only just managed to get through with their lives.
Chinese statements have invariably to be heavily discounted,
and the problem as to how far a Chinese believes
his most intimate friend has been present with
me for many years, and still remains unsolved. Instead
of following the hill road along the right bank of the
river to the city of Jung-ching, we crossed to the left
bank by a ferry a few miles from our night’s quarters,
and traversed a plain well watered and cultivated.
We saw one or two villages on the plain, but they
were miserable places, and scarcely a soul was visible
as we passed through them. Recrossing the stream
by a plank bridge, we soon caught sight of the low stone
walls of the city. The universal clanging of the blacksmith’s
anvil, loudly proclaimed the local industry.
Coal and iron are both found in the neighbourhood,
and agricultural implements, cooking pans, and crampoons
were being hammered into shape. South of Jung-ching
the valley contracts, frequently leaving room for
the bed of the stream only, and the hills are more precipitous,
rocky, and uncultivated. They were not bare,
however, for the tea-tree was everywhere prominent.</p>

<p>The village of Huang-ni-p’u lies 1400 feet above the
city of Jung-ching, and 5640 feet under the summit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the Ta Hsiang Ling, which was clad with snow. When
we awoke on the morning of the 7th of March, we found
the whole mountain enveloped in a thick mist, which
became denser as we ascended. When we reached the
Hsiao Kuan, or Lower Pass (4800 feet), the snow lay
thick by the roadside; but all around was buried in
white gloom. Huge icicles hung from rocks projecting
over the rugged path, and we frequently heard their
crashing as they fell, amid the din of roaring torrents,
into the depths below. As we ascended, the snow became
deeper, increasing from two to three inches above
the Lower Pass to a couple of feet. The pathway,
which skirts the edges of ravines and precipices, was
one continuous mass of slush, snow, and ice&mdash;higher
up, dry and crisp; and, starting from Huang-ni-p’u at
half-past six in the morning, we stood on the summit
(9366 feet) at half-past two in the afternoon, having
indulged in two short intervals of rest. A stiff, north
wind was blowing over the ridge, and I overheard one
of the escort duly warning my followers that shouting
on the summit would most certainly provoke a storm.
For a time not a sound but that of our own footfalls on
the crisp snow broke the stillness of the gloomy scene.
It became monotonous, and, when I took to snowballing
my dog in sheer desperation, my laughter and his joyous
barking made them hurry down the southern face of
the Pass.</p>

<p>On leaving the clouds, we looked down into a plain
shut in by lofty ranges and broken by spurs bounding
ravines washed out by mountain torrents. On a
plateau in the plain, stands the district city of Ch’ing-ch’i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Hsien, nearly four thousand feet below the summit
of the Ta Hsiang Ling. Down the plain, which runs
almost due north and south, flows a stream, nurtured
by the melting snows on the surrounding peaks. The
city is of no great size; but it is exceedingly interesting,
as being the junction where the main high-road
from Tibet to China and the road from Yün-nan by the
Chien-ch’ang valley meet. Here we parted with the
brick-tea carriers, sorry that it was not our fortune to
accompany them to Ta-chien-lu, and attempt the country
beyond that famous border town. From Ch’ing-ch’i
the road goes south, descending to the bases of the
precipitous mountain ranges hemming in a valley, which
expands and contracts, and is plentifully strewn with
stones and pebbles. Fifteen miles to the south of the
city, the road suddenly descends about two hundred
feet down into a wider valley. Far below us, we could
see the hamlet of Lung-tung, encircled by plots of yellow
rape and green wheat and poppy&mdash;a real oasis in
the white stony valley. This descent leads not only
to a new country, but to a new race.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A NON-CHINESE RACE.</i></div>

<p>At Lung-tung I noticed a marked difference in the
features of the people, especially the women. The
faces were sharper and more pointed than the ordinary
Chinese type, while the foreheads were exceedingly
prominent. There was an undoubted mixture of foreign,
probably Sifan, blood. It is a peculiarity of all
these non-Chinese races that the women are the last
to abandon their national dress, and they cling with
tenacity to profuse decoration. The women of Lung-tung
backed up their facial distinction with a lavish
display of silver ornaments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>For some distance south of the hamlet there was
no attempt at cultivation in the stony wilderness;
but gradually we found signs of stones having been
collected, patches of land dyked, and rivulets diverted
for irrigation purposes. Watercress was growing wild
in the limpid water. Trees, although not very numerous,
were not wanting; the mulberry, orange, red-date,
and pear were to be seen. The orange was a tall tree,
bearing a small round fruit with a thick wrinkled skin,
which reminded me forcibly of a miniature “Buddha’s
Hand”&mdash;<i>Citrus sacrodactylus</i>. Cotton in small quantities
was also growing in this valley. Many of the
houses were roofed with thin boards weighted with
stones, instead of the usual Chinese tiles, and the graves
were covered with mounds of rounded stones carefully
whitewashed.</p>

<p>The garrison town of Fu-lin, whence a bridle-path
leads over the mountains to Ta-chien-lu, lies at no
great distance from the left bank of the Ta-tu River,
the southern boundary of the valley. In the immediate
neighbourhood of the town were a few cultivated
patches; but agriculture, to judge from the precautions
taken against inundation from the waters of the Liu-sha,
which was hurrying down the valley to join the
Ta-tu, would appear to be carried on under difficulties.
A line of white shingle, running east and west, backed
by rising ground, was the only visible indication of the
presence of a watercourse, and it was only on reaching
the miserable village of Wa-wa, built on a sandbank
held together by bushes of luxuriant cactus, that we
were able to espy the green waters of the Ta-tu rushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
violently eastward in its pebbly bed, to be quickly lost
in a gap in the mountains to the south-east. Several
forks, into which the river is divided, unite to the west
of Wa-wa.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AN EXCITING SCENE.</i></div>

<p>Descending to the ferry, we found ourselves face to
face with a pure non-Chinese race. The boatmen, who
were tall&mdash;one was over six feet&mdash;wiry fellows, with
level grey eyes, at once fraternized with me and took
me under their protection. They were Sifans, and
spoke Chinese with a decidedly foreign accent. One
of them, with a fearlessness impossible in a Chinese,
asked me a few questions in a most respectful manner,
and answered with readiness and evident pleasure the
queries I put to him regarding the river. To a random
question as to its breadth, a Chinese by my side at
once answered over a hundred <i>ch’ang</i>, or one thousand
Chinese feet, but my protector quietly rebuked him,
remarking that one should not answer such a question
off-hand, and, after some reflection, said the river was
six hundred feet broad. I estimated the breadth at
nearly two hundred yards; but it was difficult to fix
distances with any accuracy in the presence of mountains
which threw everything else into insignificance.
The Sifans smiled when I tried to ascertain the depth
by plunging a bamboo over the side of the boat in mid
river.</p>

<p>Owing to numerous falls and rapids, only rafts can
be navigated the entire distance to Chia-ting Fu, where
the Ta-tu, after its junction with the Ya Ho, enters
the Min. Once a year there is a busy scene on the
banks of the Ta-tu River. In the end of April, thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>sands
of carriers have to cross the river at this very
spot, with their precious loads of white wax insects from
the valley of Chien-ch’ang, on their way to the prefecture
of Chia-ting. As delay is injurious to their living
freight, they haste and race to be first at the ferry.
Crossing the Ta-tu as we did on the 9th of March, we
were too early to witness the flight of these carriers,
which ceases not night or day. Trade, as we saw it,
was of a less exciting nature; copper and pine boards
from the south, met cotton and salt from the north.</p>

<p>In the walled town of Ta-shu-pao, less than a mile
from the south bank of the river, the fine tall men and
sprightly women of an alien race, could, without difficulty,
be picked out from the Chinese. They wore
white turbans jauntily inclined to one side, and carried
themselves with a grace that savoured of independence.
The Ta-tu River may be looked upon as the southern
limit of the region inhabited by Sifan tribes, and the
northern boundary of the Lolo country which stretches
southwards to the Yang-tsze and east from the valley
of Chien-ch’ang towards the right bank of the Min. I
found a few Sifans to the south of the Ta-tu, but they
were isolated families who had lost touch with their
respective tribes. Amongst the Chinese they have
an evil repute for immorality; yet my experience of
them, limited as it necessarily was, proved that they
possessed certain traits of character which are altogether
wanting in the Celestial, or, if not altogether
wanting, at least existing in a very rudimentary form
only.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A “TAME WILD MAN.”</i></div>

<p>One instance will suffice to explain my meaning. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
had expressed a wish for a lengthened interview with
a Sifan, and, on arrival at P’ing-pa, the second stage
south of the Ta-tu, word was brought to me that there
was a “tame wild man” in the village. With some
difficulty he was induced to come to our inn, the reason
of his hesitancy being, as he explained when alone with
me in my room, that the Chinese might treat him
badly if they knew that he was talking with me.
When I had calmed his fears and elicited from him as
much information as I could regarding his language, I
asked him before leaving to accept a couple of hundred
cash for the trouble I had caused him, and as a reward
for the knowledge which he had imparted. This he
absolutely declined, saying that he had rendered me no
service deserving of reward. As, in the course of conversation,
he had informed me that his home was in
the hills three miles distant, and that he had come to
P’ing-pa to make a few purchases, I pointed out to him
that, by accepting this trifling sum, he would be able
to secure a small present from me to his family. More
argument convinced him that there would be no harm
in accepting it on this condition, and he left after profuse
thanks on behalf of the other members of his
household. Would a Chinese have hesitated? I trow
not.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LOLO LANGUAGE.</i></div>

<p>South of P’ing-pa we found ourselves fairly in Lolodom.
When we were breakfasting at the hamlet of
Shuan-ma-ts’ao on the morning of the 11th of March,
ten wild-looking fellows suddenly put in an appearance.
They were dressed in brown felt woollen cloaks from
neck to knee, their legs and feet were tightly bandaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
with cotton cloth, they wore straw sandals instead of
shoes, and their hair was drawn forward in the shape
of a horn, projecting above the forehead and bound
with cloth. Each was armed with a long wooden
javelin, fitted with a large broad iron arrow-head.
Some snatched a hasty meal, while others sharpened
their javelins on a stone by the side of the street. We
began to think that they had sinister intentions regarding
ourselves or our property, but they quickly
disappeared in Indian file up a narrow path over the
hills to the south-west. Sheep were being driven in
the same direction, and these men were probably shepherds
preparing to ward off the attacks of wild animals
from their flocks. At Hai-t’ang, which we reached after
a steep descent, we took up our quarters in a new inn
just completed and therefore clean. As the morrow
was market-day, we resolved to be present and swell
the crowd. Snow fell heavily and somewhat dulled
the market, so I induced two out of the living mass of
Lolos to come and spend an hour or two with me at the
inn. I jotted down their numerals and a few common
words, and can thus compare my transcription of the
sounds with those taken down by Mr. Baber from Lolos
in other parts of the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be noticed that, with a very few exceptions,
these numerals are almost identical, and it may, without
any great stretch of the imagination, be taken for
granted that the Lolos speak one language with only
slight dialectic differences. Unfortunately, the men
whom I met were unable to write&mdash;that they have a
written language has been distinctly proved&mdash;so that I
was powerless to assist in deciphering what up to the
present moment remains a sealed book.</p>

<p>It will be appropriate in this place to compare the
numerals of the Sifans as taken down by different travellers
at different places, and the comparison, I think,
shows that, as in the case of the Lolos, the Sifan tribes
have also one language, with local dialectic variations.
My Sifan told me that their written language resembles
Tibetan, which is very probably the case.</p>

<p>I agree with Mr. Baber that the sound given by Mr.
Hodgson for seven is impossible. The former follows
Sir Thomas Wade, who, in transliterating Chinese characters,
uses the letter <i>j</i> to represent a semi-<i>r</i> sound;
and this will account for the seeming difference, which
does not actually exist, in the words for four and eight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
To my ear the sound was sufficiently broad to warrant
a full <i>r</i>.</p>

<p>White and brown cloaks appeared to be worn indiscriminately
by the Lolos, and during the whole of
my passage through their country I noticed only one
exception, and that was a blue cloak with red fringes.
Of this divergence from the usual custom I was unable
to find any satisfactory explanation. When we were
strolling in the market at Hai-t’ang, several loads of
China-root&mdash;<i>Pachyma cocos</i>&mdash;passed us on the way
north. This product is found in great abundance in
the hills of Ssŭ-ch’uan, and Yün-nan and is highly
esteemed as a medicine.</p>

<p>At Hai-t’ang I thought I had made a discovery
that would revolutionize the whole world of dress.
On returning from the market to my inn, I caught
sight of a piece of cloth of somewhat loose texture in
the hands of one of the waiters, and, when examining
it, was astonished to learn that, instead of being
washed when dirty, it was thrown into the fire, which
consumed the dirt and left the material itself intact.
Shades of angry washerwomen rose before my mental
vision and seemed to curse the age of invention.
Nothing deterred, I promptly put the statement to the
test, and had the pleasure of seeing the cloth extracted
from the fire clean and again ready for use. It was
described to me as being manufactured from the fibrous
roots of a grass which grows in the gullies of the mountains
in the neighbourhood. With that inconsistency
which characterises the Chinese, it was called “fire-consuming,”
not “fire-proof” cloth. Reader, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
sometimes very hard to be rudely undeceived. Must
I confess that the only discovery I made was, that asbestos
exists in Western Ssŭ-ch’uan? Washerwomen,
your career is not yet ended!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LOLO MARAUDERS.</i></div>

<p>An additional escort of Lolos joined us at Hai-t’ang.
They wore their national dress, and the petty officer in
command was further ornamented with a thin oval
brass plate, fixed in his left ear by a brass ring. We
left our comfortable quarters to face a snowstorm, and
plodded all day through snow and slush half a foot
in depth. Garrisons, each supposed to be thirty strong,
lined the road at intervals of a mile with guard-houses
between. This part of the country, skirting as it does
the western border of independent Lolodom, is the
scene of frequent Lolo raids, whole caravans&mdash;goods,
animals, and men&mdash;being swept off, and carried into
the inaccessible mountains to the east.</p>

<p>Our escorts were now relieved at each garrison,
and the men were armed with swords. Just before
entering the Yüeh-hsi plain, a soldier pointed out the
spot where, a few years previously, an army of five
thousand men had invaded Lolodom to punish marauders,
and he added that not a man had returned to tell
their fate. The buildings on the plain, which runs
north-east and south-west, are more like watch-towers
than dwelling houses; they have two storeys, but no
windows on the ground floor. We saw numbers of
Lolos in the city of Yüeh-hsi T’ing, many of them nominally
in official employ, though, in reality, salaried
hostages for the good behaviour of their tribes. Here
our escort was again strengthened, and, when we left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the city on the morning of the 15th of March, we were
preceded by an army of gaily-dressed soldiers armed
with flags, pikes, and halberts. The south of the plain
is divided into two valleys by a range of hills; that to
the south-east leads to independent Lolodom, where no
Chinese dare venture; through the other to the south-west
runs the road to Ning-yuan Fu and Yün-nan.</p>

<p>The latter gradually narrows, being bounded on the
east by precipitous rocky cliffs, and on the west by
sloping heights to a certain extent amenable to cultivation.
In the bed of the valley, which is rough and
stony, were garrisons and guardhouses fully tenanted.
Treble stockades of wooden piles were thrown up round
them, but they would be perfectly useless against a
determined raid, there being no escape in case of defeat
except by steep paths leading up the mountain sides
into the country of the Lolos.</p>

<p>During our stay at the small town of Hsiao-shao,
which lies at the end of the valley and at the northern
entrance of a narrow pass, many of my followers were
struck down by fever, and I passed a most uncomfortable
night amidst their groans&mdash;hardly a suitable
preparation for the morrow, when the Hsiao Hsiang
Ling Pass had to be surmounted. Here I found that
there were rogues even among the Lolos. Soon after
our arrival, four ruffian-looking fellows turned up, and
announced that they had been deputed to form my Lolo
escort next day. I told them that I was much gratified
at the forethought of their officials, and asked them to
come on the morrow; but they were persistent in their
demands for a gratuity beforehand. This I declined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
until their persistence became an absolute nuisance,
when I was weak enough to make them a small present
and trust to their word. Needless to say, they broke
it.</p>

<p>Having mounted my sick on ponies, we passed
through the south gate of Hsiao-shao and entered the
pass, our approach being heralded by a musket-shot
from the sentry of the Chinese and Lolo guardhouses,
which mark the entrance. A couple of guardhouses
could be made out on rocky heights up the pass to the
south-west, and their sentries, warned by the report of
the musket-shot, could be seen standing out darkly
against the snowy mountain behind. The same signal
was given by each sentry as we advanced.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ASCENT OF HSIAO HSIANG LING.</i></div>

<p>Turning south-west, we soon began the actual ascent
of the Hsiao Hsiang Ling, which, though less precipitous
than the Ta Hsiang Ling, was somewhat troublesome,
owing to the greater depth of snow. On the
summit, which is 9800 feet above the level of the sea,
we were shrouded by a white gloom which entirely hid
the surrounding country from our view. The southern
slope is gentle, the path, after a short descent, entering
a gorge which leads to the garrison town of Têng-hsiang,
lying at the feet of lofty mountains and occupying
the head of a narrow valley running north and
south. Here the soldiery were busy strengthening
the walls at the north gate. When we left by the south
gate next morning, accompanied by an additional escort
of bearers of flags, spears, swords, tridents, and muskets,
the peaks of the mountains bounding the valley on the
west side were lit by the rising sun, throwing the steep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
pine-clad sides of the eastern range into gloom. The
bed of the valley was wild and uncultivated, but the
full bloom of some wild fruit trees helped to brighten
the scene and the silence was broken only by the humming
of bees in search of food. A range running east
and west soon blocks the valley, and the road goes
west through the sub-district of Mien-shan till again
intercepted, when it turns south-west along the left
bank of a branch of the An-ning River. A rocky gorge,
with just sufficient room for the stream, then supervenes,
and the road is cut out of the solid rock to within
a short distance of the town of Lu-ku, which lies close
to the north-eastern corner of the great plain of Ning-yuan.</p>

<p>While we were watching the cormorant fishers at
the point where the stream leaves the gorge, a bevy
of Lolo women, who had been marketing at Lu-ku, came
up, and afforded us the rare opportunity of a close inspection.
They were chatting and laughing on the way
back to their mountain homes. They wore large round
caps of black cloth, <i>à la</i> “Tam O’ Shanter,” short
jackets, and petticoats just long enough not to conceal
their bare feet. A pink strip let into the skirt in front
from waist to foot seemed to be the fashion. Their
bodices were fastened at the neck by embroidered collars
decked with silver ornaments and clasps. Most of
them were pretty, but some suffered from loss and
decay of the front teeth. They might, without any
great stretch of the imagination, have been taken for a
group of Italian peasant women.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENTRY INTO NING-YUAN.</i></div>

<p>On the morning of the 18th of March we left Lu-ku,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and, ascending a low plateau, found ourselves on an
immense plain stretching southwards. The stream
which flows by the town is joined, a little to the west,
by another from the north, and the two combined form
the An-ning River, which goes south down the plain
and enters the Ta-ch’ung or Ya-lung, a large tributary
of the Yang-tsze, or, as it is here called, the Chin Chiang&mdash;the
“Golden River.” Only about twenty
miles now separated us from the prefectural city, but,
owing to the sickness of my followers, who were happily
beginning to recover in the face of the southern breezes
blowing the very breath of life into their fevered and
toil-worn frames, we had to divide the distance over a
couple of days. Early in the afternoon of the 19th of
March, we crossed the last spur which projects into
the plain from the hills which form its eastern boundary
and, passing through the beautifully cultivated
and well-wooded gardens in the suburbs and then
through a busy thoroughfare alive with pack-animals
laden with long hollow cones of salt, we entered the
west gate of Ning-yuan, more generally known in
Western China as Chien-ch’ang Fu.</p>

<p>History records that a terrible earthquake visited
the plain of Chien-ch’ang in the early years of the
Ming Dynasty, and that the old city of Ning-yuan
sank bodily into the ground, and gave place to the
large lake which lies to the south-east of the present
city. In 1850, again, according to the information
supplied to Mr. Baber, Ning-yuan was reduced to ruins
by a similar catastrophe. If the former tradition be
true, the lake had no existence when Marco Polo passed
through Caindu, and yet we find him mentioning a lake
in the country in which pearls were found. Curiously
enough, although I had not then read the Venetian’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
narrative, one of the many things told me regarding
the lake was that pearls are found in it, and specimens
were brought to me for inspection.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RECEPTION OF FOREIGNERS AT NING-YUAN.</i></div>

<p>Previous to my arrival only two foreigners had visited
Ning-yuan, and that, too, both in 1877. The first,
a Roman Catholic French Father, was stoned and driven
from the city. Two months later came Mr. Baber,
who, fortified with instructions issued by a new Viceroy,
commanded the respect of the very official who had incited
the attack on the unfortunate missionary. When
I appeared upon the scene, I had the greatest difficulty
in securing quarters, and, while search was being
made, spent an hour the target for thousands of black
eyes. But fortune did not forsake me. As soon as
I reached the inn, which was at last found, a thunderstorm
burst over the town, and brought nourishment
to the plain which had been athirst for a month.
The arrival of a foreigner and a copious rainfall were
two events which, to their superstitious minds, could
only be cause and effect, and I was soon waited upon
by a deputation of townspeople, who came to thank me
for my timely visit. From an intruder, I was suddenly
raised to the rank of a benefactor.</p>

<p>I took advantage of the presence of the deputation
to gather information regarding the products of the
plain and the mineral resources of the prefecture.
Rice, poppy, cotton, safflower, a variety of fruits, medicines
and dyes, cassia, beans, wheat and maize are
grown in their respective seasons, while copper, zinc,
and iron are found in the neighbouring hills. Mulberry
trees abound, and silk is produced and exported to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Yün-nan. But the chief product of the plain is white-wax
insects, to which allusion has already been made
and which will be found treated at length in Chapter
XI. Pine boards are also a special export from this
region. Immense trees are found deeply embedded in
the soil on the hills, their positions being discovered
from lines of pine sprouts. They are dug up, sawn, and
sent north in large quantities.</p>

<p>When I made it known that, instead of proceeding
south through Hui-li Chou to Yün-nan Fu, I was about
to attempt the road through Yen-yuan Hsien to north-western
Yün-nan and Ta-li Fu, hundreds of objections
were at once forthcoming. The road was a mere bridle-path
impassable for chairs, there were no inns, no rice,
nothing but wilderness. A very little experience in an
Eastern land teaches the traveller to discount native
statements, and I told my men that one of the objects
of my journey was to establish facts, and that I considered
it my duty to go and test the validity of the
objections raised.</p>

<p>Leaving Ning-yuan on the 21st of March, we skirted
the western edge of the lake, which is some eight miles
long and two to three broad, and made for the low hills
which bound the plain to the south-west. Eight miles
from the city we struck the left bank of the An-ning
River, and having effected a passage at the ferry, we
proceeded south over a sandy waste, whereon close reed
fences were erected to keep the sand from being blown
over the cultivated ground. Farther south, the plain
was dotted with mud houses and villages, and the plots
of arable land by which they were surrounded were
thickly edged with mulberry trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FERTILITY OF THE NING-YUAN PLAIN.</i></div>

<p>The plain from Lu-ku southwards is noted throughout
Western China for its fertility; but from that
point until south of Ning-yuan, the river flows along
the base of the lofty hills bounding the western edge
of the plain, which slopes gently from east to west,
and its waters are little available for purposes of irrigation.
The plain, therefore, depends for the most part
upon the rainfall for its water supply, and, owing as
we have seen to the fact that rain had not fallen for
a month previous to our arrival, the cracked and arid
ground, with its stunted crops of poppy, wheat, and
beans, presented a striking contrast to the glowing
description we had received of this happy Eldorado.
South of Ning-yuan, however, the plain is perfectly
level and the river winding about in it is extensively
utilised for irrigating the fields.</p>

<p>Although fortune usually smiles upon the valley of
Chien-ch’ang, the inhabitants of its many villages are
not to outward appearances a happy race. What
strikes the traveller most with regard to them is the
prevalence of the unsightly goître, from which neither
sex nor age is exempt. The natives attribute it to the
impure salt from the brine wells of Pai-yen-ching, within
the jurisdiction of Yen-yuan Hsien, and their belief
is, that north of Ning-yuan Fu the salt supply comes
from the northern salt springs, and that where this salt
is consumed, goître is exceedingly rare, while south of
Ning-yuan only local salt is used and goître is excessively
common. This can hardly be reconciled with
the statements made to me by the inhabitants of the
mountainous regions of the province of Kuei-chow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
where goître is likewise remarkably prevalent. They
were unanimously of opinion that the disease is due to
the salt from the northern springs of Ssŭ-ch’uan, which
supply the entire province of Kuei-chow. But the true
origin of the disease is doubtless to be ascribed to calcareous
and other substances held in solution in the
water supply of the districts.</p>

<p>The small town of Ho-hsi, “West of the River,”
the first stage from Ning-yuan, lies in a bend at the
foot of a mountain range, which forms the divide of the
An-ning and Ya-lung rivers. It, too, has its story of
war with nature. A small stream from the western
mountains flows through the town on its way to join
the river in the plain. In 1881, a terrific hailstorm
swept over mountain and plain; the stream became a
roaring torrent and annihilated nearly the whole town&mdash;the
number of killed and drowned being estimated
at a thousand souls.</p>

<p>Following up the stream towards its source, we
attained, after a few hours’ climb, the ridge of the
mountain, where the roads are worn out of the solid
limestone to a depth of twelve feet by the constant
traffic between the salt springs to the south-west and
Ning-yuan Fu. The steep eastern slope of the mountain
was covered with rank coarse grass, nor did cultivation
appear until the ridge was crossed. Even then
there were only a few clearings here and there, and
these were occupied by the large-leaved privet, the pear
and other fruit trees, while the uncultivated ground
was clad with stunted pine. Beyond the ridge, the
road, a mere bridle-path, runs west by south along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the mountain side, whence we could make out to the
south the green waters of the Ya-lung River flowing
north-east and suddenly bending southwards, its progress
in the former direction being obstructed by a
mountain barrier. As might be expected in such a
country, the population is very scant, and only an occasional
hut for the refreshment of the traveller was to
be seen during a day’s journey.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A TIBETAN CARAVAN.</i></div>

<p>While resting at a solitary tea-house on the mountain
side, and speculating on the advisability and wisdom
of attempting this route in chairs, I perceived in
the far south-west a long line of moving objects coming
towards us. Red flags and gaily-caparisoned mules
and ponies warned me that something more than ordinary
was approaching. The red-clad muleteers, armed
with swords and spears, and the large powerful dogs
trotting at the heads of the pack-animals, told us that
we were face to face with a Tibetan caravan. It consisted
of some fifty animals laden with medicines,
musk, and sundries. Our spirits rose as we heard that
the road was open for pack-animals.</p>

<p>Our resting-place during the night of our second
stage from Ning-yuan was the village of Tei-li-pao,
overlooking the Ya-lung River, which we reached by
a steep descent on the following morning. Ascending
its left bank for four miles through dense hedges of
prickly pear, growing with a profusion I have not seen
elsewhere in Western China, we crossed it at the ferry
of Ho-pien Hsün, a customs station on its right bank.
The river itself, which is about two hundred yards in
breadth, is deep, and flows with an even current until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
it reaches the sharp bend which I have already mentioned,
when it lashes itself into foamy billows against
submerged rocks. The Ya-lung is unnavigable, and the
only craft on its green waters were three ferry boats,
each about thirty feet long. From the bed of shingle
which lies below the customs station, we followed for a
short distance the right bank, which is here lined with
huge boulders, and then turned south-west up a gully,
down which flows a streamlet to the main river. The
country gradually opens out, and cultivation, which
had practically ceased since we left the Ning-yuan
plain, began to reappear on the gentler slopes of the
mountain sides to the south-east.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>INHOSPITABLE HANG-CHOU.</i></div>

<p>Our struggles through the day on the precipitous
banks of the Ya-lung had, we imagined, earned a good
night’s repose at the little town of Hang-chou, which
lies on the left bank of the streamlet. In this, however,
we were sadly disappointed. Surmounting a low eminence
we beheld, to our surprise, little but its charred
remains, the town having been destroyed by fire only
a few days before. On entering, we found, as might
have been expected, wretched accommodation. The
homeless inhabitants were huddled together in the few
houses that had escaped the ravages of the fire. The
mass of idlers seemed to require some outlet for the
superfluous energy which had not yet been expended
in the rebuilding of their homes. Our arrival was their
opportunity. No sooner had we settled down in the
apartment which we had the greatest difficulty in procuring,
than we were surrounded by a gaping and
insolent crowd. So insolent and threatening indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
did they become, that we had to solicit the intervention
of the local authority in suppressing what, to every
appearance, was fast becoming a riot. He came, but
his presence was powerless and his commands were
unheeded. He left, and matters assumed a still more
serious aspect. A free fight thereupon resulted between
the rioters and my followers. At this point my intervention
became necessary, and, for the first and only
time during my wanderings in China, I was compelled
to show my revolver. Happily for all, the sight of the
weapon was sufficient, and, under its awe-inspiring
muzzle, four of the ringleaders, who had threatened me
with death, were arrested. This quelled the riot for
the night, but threats were thrown out of vengeance
on the morrow. The local authority was duly warned,
and he was good enough to promise us all available
protection, and to accompany us on the next stage.
When day dawned he was duly present, and we were
glad to shake the dust of inhospitable Hang-chou and
its riotous inhabitants from our feet.</p>

<p>The valley in which Hang-chou lies contracts towards
the south-west. Recrossing the stream, the
road runs along the mountain side for some distance;
but the mountains soon recede, leaving an undulating
stretch of country rising as we advanced. This we
ascended amid low pines and dense underwood, past
numerous unworked copper-mines, until at its highest
point the road is at an elevation little below the mountain
peaks on both sides, now white with snow. Here a
thunderstorm delayed our progress; the brilliancy of
the lightning, and the roar of the thunder echoed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
re-echoed from the surrounding mountains, reflecting
credit on the forgers of Zeus. But the chilly hail and
the rude mud hut in which we were compelled to seek
shelter for the night, speedily turned our thoughts
from the dreams of classical romance to the stern
actualities of a wanderer’s life. The local authority
of Hang-chou, however, pressed on with his prisoners
to the city of Yen-yuan Hsien, where our non-arrival
excited no little consternation among the authorities,
who, anxious as to our safety, sent messengers and
soldiers to ascertain the cause.</p>

<p>With the exception of a short distance where the
road zigzags, the descent to Yen-yuan is easy. We
followed a small mountain stream down a valley for
some time, leaving it by a fine level road to the west,
and soon entered the city, which lies on the north-east
side of a plain, backed by a range of high hills running
east and west. Here due satisfaction was given to
us for the outrage at Hang-chou, whose inhabitants,
through their unwilling representatives, were taught a
practical, if a painful, lesson as to the treatment of
strangers from the West. The officials were profuse in
their apologies and in their attention to our wants,
promising absolute protection as far as the first city
across the Yün-nan frontier&mdash;a promise which was
faithfully carried out.</p>

<p>The city of Yen-yuan, though small, is the capital
of the district which borders on the province of Yün-nan,
a district rich in copper and salt, and one of the
chief habitats of that industrious and interesting creature,
the white wax insect, which is propagated on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
branches of the <i>Ligustrum lucidum</i>, or large-leaved
privet. The brine wells from which the salt is derived
lie at Pai-yen-ching, fourteen miles to the south-west
of the city, which we reached by a good road across
the plain, down which one or two rivulets flow north-westwards.
The way in which the farmers manipulate
these rivulets for purposes of irrigation is truly wonderful&mdash;here
the water ripples in one direction, there in
exactly the opposite. This plain is one of the very few
places in the province of Ssŭ-ch’uan where carts can be
utilised for transport.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SALT MAKING.</i></div>

<p>The brine wells of Pai-yen-ching, mentioned above,
are only two in number, and comparatively shallow,
being only fifty feet in depth. Bamboo tubes, ropes
and buffaloes are here dispensed with, and small wooden
tubs, with bamboos fixed to their sides as handles for
raising, are considered sufficient. At one of the wells
a staging was erected half way down, and from it the
tubs of brine were passed up to the workmen above.
Passing from the wells to the evaporating sheds, we
found a series of mud furnaces with round holes at the
top, into which cone-shaped pans, manufactured from
iron obtained in the neighbourhood, and varying in
height from one to two and a half feet, were loosely
fitted. When a pan has been sufficiently heated, a
ladleful of the brine is poured into it, and, bubbling up
to the surface, it sinks, leaving a saline deposit on the
inside of the pan. This process is repeated until a layer,
some four inches thick and corresponding to the shape of
the pan, is formed, when the salt is removed as a hollow
cone ready for market. Care must be taken to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the bottom of the pan moist; otherwise the salt cone
would crack, and be rendered unfit for the rough carriage
which it experiences on the backs of pack animals.
A soft coal, which is found just under the surface of the
yellow-soiled hills seven miles to the west of Pai-yen-ching,
is the fuel used in the furnaces. The total daily
output of salt at these wells does not exceed two tons
a day, and the cost at the wells, including the Government
tax, amounts to about three-halfpence a pound.
The area of supply, owing to the country being sparsely
populated, is greater than the output would lead one
to expect.</p>

<p>At the time when Marco Polo passed through Caindu,
this country was in the possession of the Sifans,
and there can be little doubt that the salt cakes, which
then constituted the currency, were evaporated at these
very wells. Nor are the Sifans wanting at the present
day; they occupy the country to the west, and are
known under the generic name of Man-tzŭ.</p>

<p>Our progress&mdash;I hardly like to use the word&mdash;during
the five days from the brine wells of Pai-yen-ching
to the frontier of the province of Yün-nan, a
distance of less than forty miles as the crow flies, is one
long story of mountain travelling. Several times did
we approach the frontier, but as often were we driven
back, south and south-east, by impenetrable mountain
barriers covered with pine forests. To the south, the
ranges run east and west, and a day’s work, sometimes
lasting as long as thirteen hours, consisted in climbing
and descending steep mountain sides, and in endeavouring,
with but poor success, to circumvent the huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
boulders which lay in the beds of streams in the
bottom lands between the mountain ranges, where the
road should have been. Cultivation, as can readily be
imagined, was not conspicuous in such a country; but
here we found in abundance the animal best suited to
rugged mountains, the goat. Its flesh, too, was greatly
appreciated where rice could not be procured, and where
our supplies had long since run short. To the west of
our route, we found many places inhabited by Man-tzŭ
tribes, whose districts, however, lie principally beyond
the frontier.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CLOSE PROXIMITY OF ALIEN RACES.</i></div>

<p>At Shao-shang, on the last ridge which has to be
crossed before reaching Yün-nan, six Lolos, deputed
by their chief, who had been apprised of our approach
by the Chinese authorities, awaited us to pay their
respects, and as we stood looking at the mountain
ranges within the southern province, one of them, tall
and powerful, every inch a king, stepped forth and did
us homage. Here, then, on the very borders of Ssŭ-ch’uan
and Yün-nan, we find the Lolo from the east,
the Man-tzŭ from the west, and the Chinese holding
the narrow strip of land which separates these alien
races. Alien races, and what a contrast! On the east
the Lolo, still retaining his distinctive costume, one of a
nation hemmed in, but not absorbed, by the Chinese&mdash;on
the contrary, able to raid and carry off into slavery
the people of the country bordering on his territories;
on the west the Man-tzŭ, clad in a garb differing little
from that of his conquerors, timid, and ready to flee at
the approach of a stranger. The Man-tzŭ women,
however, like the women of all these different tribes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
scattered through Western China, retain the costume
of their race, and, though on a less elaborate scale,
dress very much like their European sisters. But the
latter have not yet donned the turban, nor do they care
to walk about with unshod feet. The turbans, which
were mostly of brown cloth, were in many cases adorned
with circlets of hogs’ tusks. As among the Lolo women,
strings of beads were the favourite ear-rings.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>YUNG-PEI T’ING.</i></div>

<p>The little border town of Hui-lung-ch’ang, or Mien-hua-ti
as it is locally called, lies at the base of a high
mountain range running east and west. From the
summit of the range, which was attained after a five
hours’ climb, we could make out to the south-west
seven other ranges with similar directions, and in the
far south a clear glittering ribbon marked the position
of the Chin Chiang, the head-waters of the mighty
Yang-tsze. The tops of these sandstone ranges were
clad with dark pines, while the slopes were covered
with rank grass and shrubbery, among which herds of
ponies and water buffaloes and flocks of sheep and goats
were feeding. From Chiu-ya-p’ing, a mud-walled town
of some five thousand inhabitants, surrounded by the
two Man-tzŭ tribes&mdash;the Li-su and the Pai-yi&mdash;two
stages to the south of the Ssŭ-ch’uan-Yün-nan frontier,
where I was most hospitably entertained by a
French missionary on the 3rd of April, two roads lead
to Yung-pei T’ing, the first departmental city within
the latter province. Although we selected what was
described to us as the easier road, we were obliged to
make a long detour, and, instead of entering the city
from the north, we actually approached it from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
south. It lies in the centre of a plain some five miles
long and two broad, bounded on the north by a semi-circle
of mountains, on the east by a lofty range running
north and south, on the west by gentle hills, and on
the south by low sandstone ridges, fast disintegrating
and drifting into the plain. To the south and east of
these ridges were numerous pools of water and a rivulet,
whose edges and banks were covered with thin coatings
of soda. The sturdy little Yün-nan pony which I
rode, champed at the bitterness of the water. Yung-pei
itself is a city of very little importance. The plain
on which it stands has a stiff clayey soil, and the beans
and poppy were decidedly below the average of Ssŭ-ch’uan
crops. It is, however, the point where the
Burmese trade with Yün-nan by way of Ta-li Fu stops,
and as such deserves mention.</p>

<p>From Yung-pei the road runs south-west to the
edge of the plain, and then over hills clad with pine
and oak, until a large expanse of water lying in a plain
running north and south comes into view. On the
hill-side east of the plain we saw the first traces of the
great highway which, prior to the Mohammedan rebellion,
is said to have connected Ta-li with Ssŭ-ch’uan;
but wild grass and brushwood have all but obliterated
the remains of the broad paved roadway. The lake, a
fine sheet of clear water, is ten miles long, and at its
broadest part about five miles across, and the road, here
also paved, skirts its eastern shore. On Chinese maps
the lake is called the Ch’êng Hai; but the only name
known to the villagers living on its shores is the Hei-wu
Hai-tzŭ, the “Lake of the Black Mist.” Numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
mud villages and houses dot the plain, but they are all
in an advanced stage of decay, and their inhabitants
are evidently well acquainted with poverty, and are
miserably clad even for a hot climate.</p>

<p>We crossed and re-crossed the plain to the south of
the lake in search of the river, which is represented on
all maps of China that I have seen as connecting the
lake with the Chin Chiang, the Brius of Marco Polo.
We searched in vain; we crossed one or two deep nullahs
containing a little water, trickling not from, but to
the lake. Further south, however, a brooklet rising in
the east of the plain, and strengthened by another from
the west, flows down to the Chin Chiang. As the river
is approached, the plain, a great part of which was
lying waste, while the remainder was growing crops of
sugar-cane, cotton, poppy, and beans, contracts, and is
blocked to the south by low hills, on reaching which
the road turns west and south-west to the market-town
of Chin-chiang-kai, on the left bank of the Golden
River.</p>

<p>At this point the river presents a striking contrast
to its appearance as it flows through the central
and eastern provinces of China. About three hundred
yards in breadth, its clear waters flow gently east over
a bed of shingle, soon, however, to be cooped up in wild
mountain gorges, and ultimately to issue as a turbid,
muddy river, to become more turbid and muddy as it
nears the sea. The river was still low; the melted
snows from the Tibetan Mountains had not yet descended
to stir the quietude of its crystal waters; but
the granite foundations on which the houses of Chin-chiang-kai<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
are built, strongly shored as they are with
wooden planks at a height of fifty feet above the
shingle-bed, indicate the addition which the present
waters may annually expect.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DEVASTATION AND DISEASE.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Baber has already disposed of the question of
the navigability of the river at a point very much farther
east, and I need only remark that the queries put
by me to the ferrymen on this subject were met with
the answer “impossible.” A few hundred yards to the
west of the town of Chin-chiang-kai, where we had
been warmly received by the local authorities on the
previous evening (April 10th), and where we enjoyed a
good night’s repose undisturbed by the low murmurings
of the waters on the pebbly strand, we crossed the river
at a point where, flowing northwards, it bends sharply
to the east. The road runs south along the soft shingle
forming the right bank of the river, which is frequently
concealed in its deep sandy bed as it skirts the western
edge of the plain. Anon it touches the eastern edge,
and at this point we looked up a long reach of the river
as it flows from the west eastward, till, blocked by bold
rocky heights which have repulsed its attacks, it has
been compelled to seek a northern course. The roadway
crosses these rocky heights and descends to the
right bank of a stream, which is lost in the mighty
river at the bend.</p>

<p>The plain or valley down which the stream flows
has a most unenviable notoriety. Little can be seen in
it but the ruins caused by the Mohammedan rebellion.
Here a town enclosed by four walls, with open gates
and streets covered with wild grass, deserted, desolate;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
there, the remains of houses and villages concealed
under a luxuriant growth of shrubbery and cactus.
Notice, too, the blackened walls which have been licked
by the flames that accompanied the sword of the
Mohammedans or their conquerors. Sad enough truly,
but not all. A dreadful plague annually sweeps down
the valley and mows down its inhabitants. Can it be
wondered that few people care to risk their existence
in the plague-stricken hollow, and that accommodation
unworthy of the name is all that can be obtained? I
managed to distribute my followers over the small
village of Huang-chia-p’ing; but I was unfortunate
enough to be laid up with an attack of fever, which
compelled us to remain for a couple of days in a small
mud stable without door or window.</p>

<p>But we were within three days’ journey of Ta-li Fu,
and the hope of reaching a state of comparative comfort
spurred us on in spite of our enfeebled condition.
From Huang-chia-p’ing the road at first runs west
through uncultivated ground. Stone dykes peeping
out here and there through rank grass and cactus, were
the only traces of former cultivation; but as the road
turns south-west, patches of poppy and wheat began
to appear along the banks of the stream flowing north-east
down the valley, and the farther we advanced
the more numerous became the signs of tillage, while
the slopes of the mountains flanking the valley were
covered with tall grass and dwarf fir and oak. As we
approached Ta-wang-miao, our eyes were gladdened,
though the picture was blurred and imperfect, by the
first glimpse, through the white-hot haze of the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
sun, of the summits of the Tsang-shan range
capped with snow, at the base of which lies Ta-li Fu,
the capital of Marco Polo’s Western Carajan.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PICTURESQUE SCENERY.</i></div>

<p>Dense hedgerows of sweetbriar and bramble in full
bloom lined the pathway to the north and south of Ta-wang-miao
and greatly impeded our advance. At a distance
from the pathway, patches of ground were bright
with the purple and white flowers of the poppy,
while high up, white shining gravestones peeped out
from the tall grass with which the hills on both sides
of the valley were covered. A ridge still hid all but
the summits of the Tsang-shan from our view; but
when we had traversed the reddish flat which stretches
north-west from the brow, a magnificent panorama of
plain, mountain, and lake lay before us. We struck
the eastern rim of the plain near the northern shore of
the Erh Hai, in whose crystal waters, stretching southwards,
the snow-capped summits of the range bounding
the western edge of the plain were clearly reflected.
We felt, as we gazed on the brilliant picture, that we
were more than rewarded for our toilsome journey.
Descending the eastern rim, we soon reached the
northern margin of the lake, in skirting which we
crossed a couple of streams which enter it from the
north. A small temple, perched on a rocky height,
stands clear out of the waters in the northern part of
the lake. Than such a spot it would have been hard
to find a better vantage ground from which to view the
picture. The valleys to the north were full of poppies,
and the white fields, which stretched along the western
shore, confused the eye as they merged and were lost
in the glitter of the lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>The villages to the north of Shang-kuan&mdash;the
“Upper Fortress”&mdash;are inhabited by a race called the
Min-chia, no doubt Shans, who differ in manners, language,
and, to a certain extent, in dress from the
Chinese. Like the Man-tzŭ, they are timid in the extreme,
and afraid that by fraternizing with a stranger
they might compromise themselves with the Chinese.
As we entered the gates of Shang-kuan on the 15th of
April, I thought of the members of the French Commission,
who, in 1868, narrowly escaped from it with
their lives, and of the stout-hearted missionary who
braved the anger of the Sultan on their behalf. Père
Leguilcher still lives; he no longer hides in caves and
woods, but spends a peaceful life within the very walls
of Ta-li itself. At Shang-kuan we made the acquaintance
of several Ku-tsung, a Tibetan tribe inhabiting
the country to the north-west of Li-chiang Fu; but
the term Ku-tsung is also applied by the people of Ta-li
to Tibetans generally, and is synonymous with the Hsi-tsang
of other parts of China. The road from Shang-kuan
runs south along the plain, dividing the cultivated
land, which stretches east to the edge of the lake, from
the stony and rougher ground, which stretches west to
the bases of the Tsang-shan, near which it is covered
with mounds&mdash;the resting-places of the Mohammedan
dead. Passing through the ruins which line the approach
to the city, we entered the north gate of the
capital of Western Carajan, and were welcomed by the
Chinese authorities and no less heartily by the French
and English missionaries within its walls.</p>

<p>“The pen is mightier than the sword.” But the
pen has not yet been manufactured which is able to
present a living picture of Ta-li Fu and its environs.
I have read the few published descriptions of the
scene, and, good though some of them undoubtedly are,
how short, how far short they all fall of the reality!
I would fain throw down this worthless, halting pen,
and leave the grandeur to the imagination of the
reader, and, if I venture to daub a few rough outlines
on the canvas, I must beg that full play be given to
the imagination in adding the finishing touches.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of a day towards the end of April
1883, I stood on the north-west angle of the walls of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the city of Ta-li. Overhead, white fleecy clouds were
floating eastward across the azure blue, veiling, at
short intervals, the warm glow of the declining sun.
To the north stretched a plain studded with villages
peeping through the light green of encircling trees,
beginning to array themselves in the garb of summer.
Three miles to the west the Tsang-shan range, serrated,
capped with snow, towered seven thousand feet
above the plain, itself nearly seven thousand feet above
the level of the sea. Three miles to the east, the western
shore of a fine sheet of water, which runs the whole
length of the plain and is backed by high hills which
rise from its eastern margin, was lost among the glistening
white poppy fields, which seemed to merge in the
silver beyond; and specks of white, favoured by the cool
breezes from the snows, were skimming over the bosom
of the glorious lake. Wait a moment. The sun is
now half hidden by the white belt of snow. He is
gone. Darker and yet darker grows the face of the
giant range, throwing into still greater prominence the
numerous gullies down which flow the icy rills to nurture
the plain and then lose themselves in the waters
of the Erh Hai. How calm, how peaceful!</p>

<p>From these I am loth to turn to the city itself and
account for its ruined condition. Within this walled
square of about four miles in circumference there are
only two good streets, which cross each other at right
angles and terminate at the four gates. What of the
rest? It consists of ruined and dilapidated houses
and cultivated plots of land. During the Mohammedan
rebellion, Ta-li was the centre round which the fiercest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
struggle raged. When the rebellion broke out, it was
seized by the insurgents and held by them until they
surrendered to the Imperialist forces which beleaguered
the city. Then occurred that scene of bloodshed,
butchery, and destruction, the like of which, happily,
is to be witnessed in uncivilised countries only. Extermination
was the order passed along the ranks of the
besiegers, and the streets of Ta-li were quickly turned
into shambles ankle-deep in blood. Men, women, and
children who managed to elude the murderers fled into
the fields bordering on the lake, into which they were
ultimately hunted like wild beasts, preferring death by
drowning to mutilation, defilement, and massacre.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A DYING PATRIOT’S PRAYER.</i></div>

<p>This, then, was the answer to the prayer of the Mohammedan
leader, Tu Wên-hsiu, when he surrendered
to the besiegers. The interview is graphically described
by Mr. Baber:&mdash;“When the Mohammedans had surrendered
and given up their arms, Tu Wên-hsiu, the
so-called ‘Sultan,’ came into the camp of the besiegers,
borne in a sedan chair, and inquired for Ma, the Imperialist
commander. Being introduced into his presence,
he begged for a cup of water, which being given
him, he said, ‘I have nothing to ask but this&mdash;spare
the people.’ He then drank the water and almost immediately
expired. It appears that he had taken poison,
which was suddenly brought into action by the water.
His head was immediately cut off and exposed, and,
heedless of his prayer&mdash;probably the most impressive
and pathetic ever uttered by a dying patriot&mdash;the victors
proceeded to massacre the helpless garrison and
townsfolk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>More fortunate than the members of the Grosvenor
Mission, who were lodged in an inn where a thousand
Mohammedans were cooped up and butchered in cold
blood, I was, through the kindness and hospitality of
Mr. George Andrew, of the China Inland Mission, provided
with a comfortable room in his house, where I
rested a fortnight before turning my face toward Ch’ung-k’ing.
During my stay I visited the lake, the marble
quarries in the Tsang-shan, and the annual fair which
was being held outside the west gate. I was also
fortunate in being able to witness a review of about five
thousand troops, which took place on the parade ground
close to the Mission House. I was most courteously
received by the Commander-in-chief of Western Yün-nan,
and the Taotai, who claimed to be an old friend&mdash;having
travelled in my company to Yün-nan Fu the
previous year&mdash;was kindness itself.</p>

<p>As to the fair, I can add little to the description of
it given by Mr. Baber. The Ku-tsung, or Tibetan men
and women, were present with their encampments and
wares in great numbers, and I was so charmed with
their fine powerful dogs that I endeavoured to procure
one. The idea had, however, to be abandoned, for
the animal brought to me for inspection required the
whole strength of a Tibetan to keep him in check.
Had I bought the dog, which was offered for ten taels,
I should have had to engage his keeper also. I succeeded
in purchasing a tiger and two leopard skins,
unprepared of course, for a sum equivalent to a little over
two guineas, and, for several hundred cash, a couple of
live Amherst pheasants, which I carried in baskets to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Ch’ung-k’ing. This beautiful variety of <i>phasianidae</i>,
now common enough in Europe, is very abundant in
Western Yün-nan, where its tail-feathers are highly
prized for decking pack-animals. They are inserted,
several together, in the brow of the bridle, and wave
over the animal’s head. Trade is dear to the Chinese
heart. I found that, while I was buying, my followers
were rapidly disposing, at an immense profit, of a bundle
of razors which they had carried all the way from
Ch’ung-k’ing.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MARBLE QUARRIES.</i></div>

<p>Small slabs of white marble streaked with dark
green, and supposed to represent trees, mountains, and
lakes, were extensively exposed for sale in the shops
and on street stalls. Their abundance pointed to a very
considerable industry, the working of which I resolved
to see for myself. One morning, taking a few men with
me and a guide, I left the city by the north gate, and,
proceeding over the plain in a north-westerly direction,
struck, in a couple of hours, the base of the mountains
where the ascent to the quarries begins. A stiff climb
of over three thousand feet through a botanist’s paradise
landed us at the mouth of a quarry, where a
number of men were bringing out blocks of pure white
marble. I told the workmen that I was anxious to see
streaked marble in the rough; but they innocently
replied that such marble was rare indeed, and that
they considered themselves lucky if they came across
such a block in the course of a year. Whence, then,
all the streaked marble? The villagers on the plain
can answer the question, for to them is confided the
polishing, painting, and baking of the slabs, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
filling up of inequalities with bees’ wax. A scene to
suit a purchaser’s taste can be ordered in advance.
The inhabitants of the Ta-li plain are not behind their
brothers on the eastern seaboard. A couple of pods of
musk, which had been purchased for a trifle at the fair,
were brought to me to look at; although to outward
appearances they were intact, a close inspection revealed
that they had been opened, and again carefully closed
by means of a needle and thread. Their buyer probably
paid a high price for all the musk which they contained.</p>

<p>From the quarries a splendid panorama of plain and
lake stretched below us. To the north lay Shang-kuan,
with its extended southern wall connecting the lake
with the western mountains&mdash;the northern defence of
the city and plain. Hsia-kuan&mdash;the “Lower Pass or
Fortress”&mdash;was concealed by mountain spurs, which
creep into the plain to the south of the city. The two
pagodas, each of thirteen storeys, which grace the plain
between the city and the Tsang-shan, and which are
built of bricks stamped with Tibetan characters, looked
in the distance like inverted clubs. As we sat drinking
in this never-to-be-forgotten scene, a number of Min-chia
maidens, with bundles of pine branches on their
backs, passed swiftly down the mountain side. The
most striking part of their dress was a close-fitting
black cloth cap, shaped very like a fireman’s helmet, and
adorned with rows of white beads. Our appearance, I
regret to say, somewhat hastened their movements.</p>

<p>As might naturally be expected, the half of the
Ta-li plain which lies near the foot of the Tsang-shan
range, is less fertile than the eastern half. It consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of stones, pebbles, and gravel, which have been quickly
dropped by the mountain streams, while the finer particles
of mud have been carried along to add to the soil
of the half bordering on the lake. The shores of the
lake itself are composed of fine yellow sand thickly
scattered with a variety of large shells. Cold water,
whether for drinking or washing, is abhorrent to the
Chinese; and when, on reaching the lake one day, I
expressed my desire to engage a small boat at a fishing
hamlet to take me out for a swim, my local escort stood
aghast and tried to dissuade me with all sorts of imaginary
dangers. The end of it was that we were soon,
escort included, at a distance from the shore; and my
little dog and I, followed by our guardians in the boat,
disported ourselves for a quarter of an hour, chasing
each other in the clear cool lake. The fish in the lake,
to judge from the specimens I saw caught, belong to the
carp family.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHINESE PREJUDICE.</i></div>

<p>As a general rule, the Chinese, as I have just remarked,
abhor to eat or drink anything cold; but in
Ta-li, snow mixed with sugar is eagerly devoured by
the people in summer. This brings me to the question
of perpetual snow on the Tsang-shan range, and, although
snow is visible on the plain for only ten months,
yet there can be no doubt that it is found during the
other two months in the crevices near the summit, and
can be bought in the streets throughout the whole year.
The temperature even in summer is delightful; the
wind sweeps down from the snows in sudden gusts and
cools the atmosphere of the plain. Of these sudden
gusts I had myself a somewhat startling experience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
As we neared the city on the day of our arrival, the
large heavy top of my official chair, weighted though it
was with pens, ink, paper, and thermometers, was lifted
up bodily and carried into an adjacent field. Another
effect of the presence of the Tsang-shan is that the
crops are always late, the early setting of the sun
behind the range depriving the plain of two hours’ daily
sunshine.</p>

<p>So pleasant had been our stay in Ta-li that I was
troubled with a heavy heart when, on the morning of
the 2nd of May, everything was ready for a fresh start,
and I had to bid good-bye to my kind host, who worked
at his remote station with a heartiness and a will that
I have not seen surpassed. To me, Ta-li and its surroundings
had become a kind of paradise, and had it
not been that duty called me back to my post, I would
fain have lingered there during the summer months.
Passing through the south gate we entered a long-ruined
suburb, which in former years must have been
very extensive. Streets and cross streets are numerous;
but the floors of the fallen houses have been converted
into vegetable gardens. There is, indeed, a legend that
in palmier days this suburb ran as far as Hsia-kuan, a
busy town on the high-road which connects China and
Upper Burmah, ten miles to the south of Ta-li. Frontier
towns are noted, however, as the cradle of romance,
and, if I could remember half the myths which were
related to me about the White Prince of the “Country
of the Golden Teeth,” of which Ta-li is a part, they
would make a very interesting volume. The object of
my journey was, fortunately or unfortunately, to collect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
facts, not fables; but to the student of folklore, untrammelled
with trade statistics, I can confidently
recommend the Ta-li plain as a happy hunting-ground.
The lake is drained by a river which, leaving its south-western
corner, divides Hsia-kuan into two parts, and
then goes west and south to join the Mekong, or, as it
is called in China, the Lan-tsang Chiang.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHINESE TRADE WITH BURMAH.</i></div>

<p>Some days previous to my departure from Ta-li,
I despatched my writer to Hsia-kuan to collect all
available information on the subject of Chinese trade
with Burmah; and, on my arrival there, I spent some
time in overhauling the statistics which he had amassed,
and in obtaining corroborative evidence. This, added
to valuable information which I subsequently obtained
from a gentleman in Bhamo, led me to the conclusion
that the total annual value of the trade between Western
China and Burmah amounted at that time to about
half a million sterling. As we were discussing trade
matters in the inn, a crowd of Canton peddlers turned
up, and grinned from ear to ear at the strange apparition
of a foreigner so far from the seaboard. They were
a rough-looking lot; instead of the usual carrying pole,
at the ends of which the loads are swung, each was
provided with a wooden spear fitted with a long iron
blade, from which dangled an antiquated horse-pistol.
They were on their way to Ta-li to exchange their
wares for new opium. Hsia-kuan lies much nearer to
the nearest point on the Burmese frontier than to Yün-nan
Fu, and, had I possessed the necessary authority,
how gladly would I have gone west to Bhamo. It was
not to be, and I had to content myself with walking to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the western end of the town, and looking longingly in
the direction of our Indian Empire, so near, and yet to
remain unvisited.</p>

<p>There is little for me to add to the descriptions
given by Margary, and by Messrs. Baber and Davenport
of the Grosvenor Mission, of the country between Ta-li
Fu and Yün-nan Fu. After our experiences of the Chien-ch’ang
valley, it was so tame and monotonous that I
resolved to push on with all despatch, and we succeeded
in covering the distance of two hundred odd miles in
thirteen days without resting. Of the six cities which
lie on the high-road, the only one that may be singled
out for special mention is Ch’ao Chou, the end of the
first stage from Ta-li. It showed more promising signs
of revival than any of the others. Chên-nan Chou,
Ch’u-hsiung Fu, Kuang-t’ung Hsien, Lu-fêng Hsien,
and An-ning Chou were in a very dilapidated condition.
In most of them the walls, which were breached, had
not been repaired; nor within the walls was there any
marked indication of returning prosperity. In many of
the villages, however, building operations were going
forward apace. To say that the road was best where
there was no road may seem paradoxical. It is nevertheless
true, for, where the paving had disappeared,
fine battened sand or clay gave an excellent foothold
except when it rained. In many places paved mounds
rose in the middle of the roadway, and these were carefully
avoided by man and beast. Not unfrequently,
too, so distorted was the paving that it had every
appearance of having been convulsed by an earthquake.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CURIOSITY DOMINANT.</i></div>

<p>East of Ch’ao Chou the cities occupy valleys drained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
by streams, which go north to join the Yang-tsze.
Between the valleys are hill ranges covered with pine,
oak, and brushwood, affording excellent cover for game.
It was no uncommon occurrence for half a dozen pheasants
to rise from the cover by the roadside, startled at
our approach, and drop within easy range. Poppy,
wheat, and beans occupied the few patches of ground
under cultivation among the hills. On the third day
from Ta-li we skirted the southern shore of a large lake,
called the Ch’ing-lung Hai, which was literally covered
with duck. An incident which occurred the same
evening photographed that picture on my mind. We
lodged for the night in the miserable village of Yün-nan-yi,
where, with an exhausted larder, I could get
nothing to eat for love or money. It is not a very
pleasant position to be stranded in the dark without
food, and to know that only a few miles off there are
thousands of duck cackling to their hearts’ content.
On the whole, I thought it as well to take the matter
philosophically, so I smoked vigorously for an hour to
ward off hunger, and then went to bed. Next day
at noon, while I sat in my chair in the street which
constitutes the village of Shui-p’ang-p’u, breaking my
fast by devouring a couple of hard boiled eggs, I found
myself the object of intense attraction to the inhabitants,
who were parading backwards and forwards with
a business air that seemed somewhat out of harmony
with their wretched surroundings. Their curiosity was
still unsatisfied when the head, and gradually the ponderous
body, of a camel appeared at the other end of the
street. In a moment we were deserted, and as we left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the village we looked back, and saw the whole population
following the camel westwards.</p>

<p>On the seventh day from Ta-li we reached the
remains of the prefectural city of Ch’u-hsiung, where
we were received with marked attention and courtesy
at the hands of the local authorities. A mile from the
city a temporary reception room was erected, and a
captain, with a file of soldiers, awaited our arrival, and
conducted us to a spacious inn outside the west gate;
and early next morning the same ceremony was repeated
outside the east gate. On the 10th of May we
lodged for the night in the village of Shê-tz’ŭ, to the
immediate west of which branches a road to the chief
salt wells in the province, about fifty miles to the north.
Up to this point, nothing of commercial importance had
been noticed going eastward; but from Shê-tz’ŭ to
Yün-nan Fu there was one long string of caravans laden
with pan salt. From the east came caravans of cut
tobacco from Chao-chou Fu, in the Canton province,
straw hats, and tin from the Kuo-chiu-ch’ang mines in
the district of Mêng-tzŭ, in the south of the province.
They were bound for Ta-li and the west of Yün-nan.
The tobacco was said to be in exchange for tin exported
from the above-named mines to Tonquin. Soon after
leaving Shê-tz’ŭ we came upon a man carrying a sack,
the contents of which&mdash;seven bundles of despatches,
letters, and papers forwarded to me from Ch’ung-k’ing&mdash;were
soon emptied by the road-side. At Ta-li, Père
Leguilcher favoured me with a perusal of the latest
telegrams which he had received by native post from
Ch’ung-k’ing, where all the important items of news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
appearing in the Shanghai papers are translated by,
and printed under the superintendence of, my friend
Père Vinçot, and forwarded to the various Mission
Stations throughout the West of China.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A ROADSIDE TRIAL.</i></div>

<p>While I was deep in the middle of my letters, my
escort came up with a man they had made a prisoner,
and I at once proceeded to hold a roadside investigation.
The charge brought against him was that he had allowed
one of the animals of his caravan to push one of
my baggage waggons, with a bearer, down a gully
which the road skirted, much to the damage of the
baggage and the injury of the bearer. An examination
of the former failed to prove any damage, while the
latter had escaped with a few skin-deep bruises about
the face. After a prolonged inquiry, I found that both
parties were to blame; but I added a rider that I was
of opinion that the chief blame lay with the local
authorities, who allowed the road to remain in such a
frightful condition. My own men grumbled at the
decision; but I ordered the immediate release of the
driver, and advised him to hurry back to his caravan
as fast as his legs could carry him&mdash;which he did.</p>

<p>A noble stone bridge of seven arches&mdash;the most substantial
and artistic I have seen in Western China&mdash;spans
a stream which flows southwards to the west of
the district city of Lu-fêng, on its way to swell the
Song-koi. The city itself is badly ruined; but the
plain in which it lies contrasts very favourably in an
agricultural point of view with the valley occupied by
the next city to the east&mdash;An-ning Chou. The latter
suffered severely during the rebellion. The walls lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
where they fell, the gates are wanting, and the whole
scene was dreary, desolate, and dead. There is, indeed,
a local industry of inconsiderable proportions. In the
eastern part of the city are three wells, about a hundred
feet deep, containing weak brine, which, on being
passed through earth, leaves a saline deposit. From
this, which is collected and placed in water, salt is
evaporated and consumed locally. The river which
drains the Yün-nan Fu lake flows north under the
eastern wall of the ruined city to the Yang-tsze. The
village and tax-station of Pi-chi-kuan crowns the last
ridge that has to be crossed before descending into the
large plain, wherein lie the provincial capital and the
lake. Instead of following the high-road we made for
the north-western margin of the lake, and at the fishing
village of Kao-ch’iao engaged a couple of junks, which
bore us eastward, with the aid of a stiff breeze, past
beds of tall reeds sheltering teal, duck, and geese, to
within a short distance of the western wall of the
capital.</p>

<p>In Yün-nan Fu I found Mr. Mesny, of the Chinese
Military Service, whom I had met eleven weeks before
in Ch’êng-tu. He had now made up his mind to proceed
to Canton by way of the West River, and he was good
enough to give me the first offer of his horse and mule,
which he could easily have disposed of to Chinese. I
closed with his offer, and a bargain was soon struck.
The same kind hospitality was held out to me by the
members of the French and China Inland Missions as
on my previous visit, and I spent three very pleasant
days with old and new friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Three roads lead from Yün-nan Fu to Ch’ung-k’ing;
there is the road by way of Tung-ch’uan and Chao-t’ung
to the Yang-tsze, and the road by way of Kuei-yang,
the capital of the province of Kuei-chow. Both of these
routes I traversed in 1882. But there is an intermediate
road which, leaving the high-road to Kuei-yang
at Chan-i Chou, goes north and east through the north-west
corner of Kuei-chow to the Yung-ning River and
the Yang-tsze, and this route I now decided to follow.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PROSPECTIVE TRADE OUTLOOK.</i></div>

<p>Before giving a description of this country, however,
I must say a word about the West of Yün-nan,
and the prospects of trade across the Burmese frontier.
The most casual reader will have observed that the province
of Yün-nan is covered with ruined cities, towns,
and villages; that its soil, fruitful without a doubt, is
only partly cultivated; and that its population is exceedingly
scant. True it is, immigration is taking place
from the northern province of Ssŭ-ch’uan, and lands
laid waste by the rebellion are being taken up; but the
process is very slow, for, among the hardy Ssŭ-ch’uanese,
Yün-nan has an evil name, and they are loth to quit
their own productive fields to till what is at present
inferior land. Room must, however, be found for the
ever-increasing population of Ssŭ-ch’uan, which is surely
destined to develop both Kuei-chow and Yün-nan; yet
many years must elapse before such a happy consummation
can be effected. Until that time comes, no great
development of our trade with Western China through
Burmah need be looked for. It will be said that these
are the views of a pessimist, and that the introduction
of railways would put new life into the country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Granted that there are people foolish enough to furnish
capital for the construction of railways through an impossible
country&mdash;that is, supposing the necessary permission
to have been obtained&mdash;I have yet to learn
that there can be trade without trade-products, and
that shareholders would expect no remuneration from
their capital. It will be time enough to think of railways
when half the province of Yün-nan is under cultivation
and some of its dead industries have been
revived.</p>

<p>Having in a previous chapter described the country
between Kuei-yang Fu and the capital of Yün-nan, I
need offer no apology for requesting my reader to accompany
me once more into the plain of Chan-i Chou,
now yellow with golden wheat, and thus obviate the
necessity of describing another weary ride over the
red uplands of Eastern Yün-nan. Yet I would fain
impart that confidence which was placed in me by
some scholars who were my companions during these
five stages; and, to this end, I must first say a few
words on the subject of competitive examinations in
China.</p>

<p>With few exceptions, these examinations are open
to any candidate who thinks he possesses sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
ability to pass. The lowest degree is that of licentiate,
and the examination takes place at the capital of the
prefecture within which the candidate’s district happens
to be. The next degree is that of provincial
graduate, the examination for which is also triennial,
and is held in the capital of the province. The candidates
for this second degree are mostly those who have
taken the degree of licentiate in open competition. The
competition for the highest degree, that of metropolitan
graduate, takes place at Peking in the year following
the examinations for provincial graduates throughout
the Empire, to whom alone it is open. Success in this
final examination is always a certain stepping-stone to
official employment. I speak of the civil, not of the
military service. To provincial graduates proceeding
to compete at the metropolis, passes are issued on application,
and these, pasted on their cases, exempt their
baggage from examination and taxation <i>en route</i>. This
is no small matter, for a graduate’s effects usually consist
of some of the products or manufactures of his province,
for which he can find a ready market in Peking.
My companions were three in number, and they were
jointly interested in a caravan of seventeen pack-animals
laden with protected cases, which they unhesitatingly
told me contained opium and marble from Ta-li. It
would be a consideration to many a Scotch student if,
in going up to London to compete in the Civil Service
Examinations, they were allowed to carry with them as
baggage a few kegs of duty-free whiskey!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>QUARTERED IN A CHIMNEY.</i></div>

<p>In parts of the Chan-i plain, which we entered on
the afternoon of the 22nd of May, some little anxiety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
was being manifested as to the supply of water for irrigation
purposes. At one spot we found the high-road
dammed, and my followers had to doff their nether
garments before they could get through. The luckless
peasants did not escape considerable abuse. “How
dare you,” rose the angry shouts, “turn the roads into
reservoirs?” A low undulating plateau, only partly
cultivated, succeeds the plain to the north-east. The
few villages dotted about were partly concealed in
groves of walnut trees, and the encircling crops of oats,
potatoes, beans, buckwheat, Indian corn, wheat, and
poppy were decidedly inferior. What else could be
expected of a light clay soil? There was one redeeming
feature about this plateau, however, which should not
be passed over. The roads were available for cart-traffic.
Would our quarters be sufficiently comfortable
to detain us over the 24th of May? was the question
that occupied my mind as I rode into the village of
Lai-yuan-p’u on the evening of the 23rd, drenched to
the skin, and far in advance of my followers. We had
been overtaken in the open by a tremendous rain-storm,
and I left the caravan and pushed on for shelter. I
immediately selected the loft as my share of the inn,
and everything promised well until my men turned up,
when a fire had to be lit to dry their clothes and cook
our food. It was only then that I discovered that the
smoke had no outlet except through the loft, that I
had, in fact, taken up my quarters in the chimney of
the inn. The loft had to be abandoned for a mud cell
on the ground floor, and the morrow’s holiday had to
be dispensed with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>To the north of Lai-yuan-p’u the road passes through
a short barrier of rocky heights, and enters a small plain
containing a village and a lakelet to the north-east of it.
To this succeeds an undulating, all but uncultivated,
rain-washed plateau, where the road was in many places
swept away&mdash;deep nullahs showing the direction the
torrents had taken. This plateau was not altogether
without value, for it contained numerous wells or pits
whence coloured clays for the manufacture of earthenware
were being extracted.</p>

<p>Here the people were of a very inquisitive turn of
mind. To have to take one’s meals in a chair is bad
enough&mdash;infinitely preferable, nevertheless, to a smoky,
dirty, mud cell; but to be surrounded by a mob of
gaping men, women, and children, watching every
mouthful, does not tend to the preservation of temper,
and it required all the banter I could command to make
even a temporary impression and keep the peace. This
was our experience a few miles to the south of Hsüan-wei
Chou, the last city through which we had to pass
before entering the province of Kuei-chow.</p>

<p>This city, which is of very little importance, lies on
the left bank of a stream flowing south-east to swell
the West River, and not the Yang-tsze, as some map-makers
would try to make us believe. Coal and iron
are both found in the neighbourhood, and a coolie, with
a load of the latter on his back, asked us whether it was
the case, as he had heard, that the Governor-General
of Yün-nan and Kuei-chow was in want of all the available
metal for the manufacture of guns. I regretted
my inability to satisfy the curiosity of this would-be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
trader. Lime is also found and was being extensively
used as manure.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TRAVELLERS, BEWARE OF T’ANG-T’ANG!</i></div>

<p>T’ang-t’ang, the terminus of the first stage from and
to the north-east of Hsüan-wei, is approached through
a series of narrow valleys separated by precipitous
hills. It lies on a hill-side near the meeting of two
streams. How well I remember the miserable village!
Travellers, beware of T’ang-t’ang! Its bugs were ravenous,
and a sorry figure we all cut next day as we
hurried to the Kuei-chow frontier.</p>

<p>From T’ang-t’ang the road ascends northwards to
the hamlet of Mu-kua-shao, whence commences a
steep descent to a narrow valley which leads to the
K’o-tu River flowing east. On the way down, we
passed through the hamlet of Shui-t’ang-p’u, insignificant
in itself, but destined at some future time to be
of greater importance.</p>

<p>A few hundred yards to the south-east of the hamlet
there is a silver mine, which may some day prove productive.
The owners bewailed to me their inability to
make the mine do more than pay the expenses of working.
Yet what could be expected from the ordinary
Chinese furnace which was employed to smelt the ore?</p>

<p>Although a narrow strip of land on the north bank
of the river is within the jurisdiction of Yün-nan, the
K’o-tu may, for all practical purposes, be considered
the boundary at this point of the Yün-nan and Kuei-chow
provinces.</p>

<p>A plaited bamboo rope was stretched across the
river&mdash;about sixty feet broad&mdash;and used by the ferrymen
for hauling their boat backwards and forwards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
High cliffs, up which the road zigzags, form the north
bank and tower above the river. This borderland is
very rich in metals; silver, as I have just said, is found
to the south of the river, and to the immediate north
copper and lead are both worked. The copper reefs
would appear to run right across Southern Ssŭ-ch’uan
and north-eastern Yün-nan into the west of Kuei-chow.</p>

<p>Wei-ning Chou, the first city within the Kuei-chow
borders, is picturesquely situated on rising ground, a
few hundred yards from the northern margin of the
eastern portion of a large lake, which, like the smaller
basins a few miles to the north, would appear to have
no outlet. The same phenomenon, if it may be called
a phenomenon, is observable in the Chao-t’ung plain in
north-eastern Yün-nan. We have already seen, however,
that underground rivers are very common in
Kuei-chow and Yün-nan, and it is not impossible that
the surplus waters of the lake may find their way by
underground channels into the head-waters of the K’o-tu
River, which is over a thousand feet below the level
of the Wei-ning plain. To reach the city we skirted
the eastern shore of the lake, crossing a small three-arched
stone bridge which spans a rivulet draining
a valley to the south-east and entering the lake. To
the north-east of Wei-ning, the paved road, which
runs through small basins full of coal, was in such an
excellent state of repair that our animals fought shy of
it, preferring the rough grassy ground through which
it passes. Here we found ourselves again among
Miao-tzŭ, busy tilling their fields. The women were
as usual clad in their native dress, while the men
wore coarse hempen clothes in Chinese style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>“LEATHER” PAPER.</i></div>

<p>Twenty miles north of Wei-ning, the road goes east
for four days through rough mountainous country to
the busy city of Pi-chieh Hsien, on the left bank of a
tributary of the Wu Chiang, and nearly 5000 feet
above the level of the sea. Twenty-five miles to the
east of the city is the second depression of any importance
on the road from Yün-nan Fu to the Yang-tsze.
This depression forms the bed of the Ch’i-hsing River,
one of the two main branches of the Wu Chiang, and
is little more than four thousand feet above the level
of the sea. The river is crossed by a stone bridge of
two arches, with spans of eighteen and fifteen yards
respectively, with a centre pier five yards broad, so
that the total breadth of the Ch’i-hsing at this point
is thirty-eight yards. The bridge is roofed and adorned
with three pavilions, one at either end and one on the
centre pier. Although the wooden floor is thirty feet
above the river, I was told that it was by no means
safe during floods, and that the water frequently
swept over it. Fifty yards to the north of the present
structure are the two piers of a former stone bridge,
which came to grief during a flood. Pi-chieh is a
great depôt for Ssŭ-ch’uan salt, which finds its way
to Western Kuei-chow by the Yung-ning River as far
as Yung-ning Hsien, and thence overland by pack
animals and carriers. In Pi-chieh I saw a quantity
of that famous tough paper which is manufactured in
the province of Kuei-chow, and which is wrongly called
“leather” paper. The mistake is pardonable, for the
character which means “leather” also means “bark;”
and the paper is made from the fibrous inner bark of
the <i>Broussonetia papyrifera, Vent.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>There is considerable romance in the names which
the Chinese apply to their cities and villages. At the
end of the first stage from Pi-chieh is the village of
Chin-yin-shan, the characters for which, literally translated,
mean “Gold-silver-mountain.” True, the street
occupies the face of a hill; but the precious metals, to
judge from the surroundings, were conspicuous by their
absence.</p>

<p>It not unfrequently happens, however, that the
name is in strict accordance with actual facts. On our
second stage from Wei-ning Chou we passed through
a village called T’ien-ch’iao, or T’ien-shêng-ch’iao&mdash;“Heaven’s
Bridge,” “Heaven-born Bridge,” or “Natural
Bridge”&mdash;which is really built on the top of a limestone
cavern through which a stream has pushed its
way. Some twenty years ago this latter village was
the scene of a dreadful catastrophe. Gold and silver,
so runs the story, were both found in a mountain a little
to the east of the high-road, and one day, when the
miners were all at work, the tunnelling collapsed and
buried every soul. Since that time all attempts to find
the ore have failed.</p>

<p>Squalid though the villages were, evident signs of
improvement were manifesting themselves, and the
following proclamation, which had lately been issued by
the Financial Commissioner of the province of Yün-nan,
and which was widely posted along the whole route,
may have accounted for the unwonted energy which we
observed:&mdash;“The copper, which the mines in Yün-nan
are bound to supply annually for use in Peking, was in
former years conveyed to Lu Chou for export, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
that time there was a flourishing trade along the route.
Within recent years the sea route has been attempted,
with the result that this trade has dwindled into insignificance.
The Board of Revenue has now decided
that the copper shall be carried by the old route, so
that people and traders of Yün-nan and Kuei-chow
may look forward to more prosperous times. The
copper from the prefectures of Tung-ch’uan and Chao-t’ung
will go to Hsü-chou Fu [Sui Fu], and from the
district of K’un-ming [within which the capital of
Yün-nan lies] to Hsü-yung T’ing [the highest navigable
point on the Yung-ning River, which enters the
Yang-tsze to the west of Lu Chou]. On these two
important routes, by which the copper is to be conveyed
into Ssŭ-ch’uan, make all haste to open hostelries
for the accommodation of these consignments of
copper and their carriers. This will cause a development
of trade generally, and traders and people along
these roads may depend on a profitable business.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A PLEASURE IN STORE.</i></div>

<p>In many places to the north of Pi-chieh the high-road
reminded me of a country lane at home. It was
frequently hedged with dense bushes of sweetbriar and
hawthorn laden with blossom, and had it not been for
the universal poppy, the resemblance would have been
far more complete.</p>

<p>The 6th of June was a day of great excitement
amongst my followers, as we were to cross the Kuei-chow
frontier and rest for the night within the Ssŭ-ch’uan
border. A dense mist obscured everything at
the start, and it was not till the great event of the day&mdash;the
descent to the Ch’ih-shui River&mdash;began, that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
were enabled to get a view of the country that lay
before us. The village of Kao-shan-p’u stands on the
southern rim of the third great depression between
Yün-nan Fu and the Yang-tsze. Beyond the deep defile
lies the Hsüeh-shan range running east and west,
over 5000 feet above the level of the sea and at least a
thousand feet higher than the southern rim. Up its
face zigzags the narrow stone road, visible almost to
the summit of the range. Down from the southern
rim runs the roadway for a distance of ten <i>li</i>&mdash;equal to
nearly three miles&mdash;to the right bank of the river flowing
swiftly eastward. The river, which is eighty yards
broad, is about two thousand feet above the level of the
sea, and, as it enters the Yang-tsze at the city Ho-chiang
Hsien ninety-five miles to the south-west of
Ch’ung-k’ing, it is not navigable in its upper waters,
there being a fall of about thirteen hundred feet.
Few facilities are provided for the passage of the immense
traffic which exists between the province of Ssŭ-ch’uan
and the provinces of Kuei-chow and Yün-nan;
a couple of ferry-boats, each sixty feet long, and capable
of carrying ten pack-animals and their drivers,
afford the only means of crossing.</p>

<p>The white-washed houses of the village of Ch’ih-shui
Hsün or Ho-pei Hsün, as it is also called, on the
north bank straggle from the mountain foot a short
distance up, and here we found shelter for the night.
Next morning, we ascended by a series of steps for a
distance of twenty-five <i>li</i>&mdash;nearly eight miles&mdash;to a
solitary temple crowning a ridge which the road surmounts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>If I assume&mdash;and it is no great assumption&mdash;that
the river forms the apex of a right-angled triangle with
sides three and eight miles long respectively, a simple
mathematical calculation will give the distance in a
straight line from rim to rim. Now, this is the route
by which it has been proposed to carry a railway from
Burmah through the Shan States and Yün-nan to Ssŭ-ch’uan,
and, granting that the necessary permission
could be obtained, who will undertake to bridge the
chasm and who will pay the piper?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A CHILD OF NATURE.</i></div>

<p>The descent of the Hsüeh-shan on the north side is
very precipitous, the road winding downwards to the
hamlet and coal mines of Lan-ma-lu, where a somewhat
curious spectacle attracted my attention. Seated near
the mouth of one of the two tunnels was a begrimed
and dirty miner clad in the garb of Eden prior to the
Fall, and in his hands clasping a tiny red flower, which
he was caressingly applying from time to time to his
olfactory organ. Here, surely, was a case in which a
man was to be judged not by his exterior, but by his
inclinations and actions.</p>

<p>It was on the following day, when we were making
our way through the ridges which bar the path to the
north of the Hsüeh-shan, that we came up with a
refractory roadside deity. His tongue, which slightly
protruded, had been lavishly smeared with opium, and,
as might naturally be supposed, he appeared to object
strongly to the drug in its crude form, for it had
trickled down and disfigured his neck and breast!</p>

<p>From the market-town of Mo-ni-ch’ang, our resting
place for the night after the passage of the Hsüeh-shan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the road runs northwards for two days through valleys
and hilly country to the Yung-ning River and the city
of Yung-ning Hsien, from which the river derives its
name. In one or two of the valleys there was no natural
outlet for the streams to which the encircling hills
gave birth, and exits had been cut through the solid
rocky heights. Yung-ning Hsien and Hsü-yung T’ing
occupy the right and left banks of the river respectively,
a stone bridge connecting the two cities. Here
we found ourselves in the centre of bustle and business,
and, what delighted us more than anything else, in
direct water communication with the Yang-tsze and
Ch’ung-k’ing. Our overland journeying was, for the
present, at an end.</p>

<p>In Chapter IV., I referred to the Hêng River and
described our descent of the Nan-kuang River, which is
blocked near its entrance to the Yang-tsze by a rocky
reef barring navigation. On reaching the district city
on the 9th of June, I immediately proceeded to make
arrangements for our conveyance to Lu Chou, a great
trade centre on the north bank of the Yang-tsze, a few
miles to the east of its junction with the Yung-ning.
I had little difficulty in engaging for a small sum a boat
which had just discharged its cargo of salt and was
about to descend. It lay with a number of others of
the same class under the walls of the city, and on the
morning of the 10th of June we embarked, leaving our
animals to be walked overland to Ch’ung-k’ing in charge
of the horse-boy. Although our boat, which was narrow
and about fifty feet in length, drew little water, we had
no sooner got her bows down stream than she grounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
in mid-river, necessitating several of the crew jumping
overboard and pushing her off the shallows.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A PERILOUS POSITION.</i></div>

<p>For some miles north of Yung-ning Hsien the river
retains its breadth of fifty yards, flowing between
low hills which were well cultivated. These give place
to a rocky country, huge boulders lining the banks and
encroaching on the river’s bed to such an extent as to
leave only sufficient breadth for one boat to pass. This
cooping-up of the waters and declivity in the bed give
rise to a series of rapids, two of which are really dangerous.
In this, what may be called, mid-section of the
river, oars were abandoned (there not being room to use
them), and the navigation was conducted by means of a
long spar which projected over the bows, and had often
as many as six of the crew hanging on to its butt end.
At one of the dangerous rapids we narrowly escaped
being dashed to pieces. The boat was rushing down at
full speed through huge boulders to a four foot fall,
when the bow spar snapped in two, the projecting part
falling into the river, the butt end rolling on deck
and the crew sprawling over and under it. Amid their
frantic yells the steersman, fortunately, did not lose his
head, and succeeded in bringing us up alongside the
rocks just above the fall. We were now perfectly helpless,
and the greater part of the afternoon of the 11th
was spent by the skipper in visiting adjacent villages
in search of a new spar. He was at length successful,
and over the fall we went, the planks of the boat
quivering under us.</p>

<p>To the north of the rocky section the country opens
out, gently undulating and cultivated; the sloping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
banks of the river, which here attains a breadth of a
hundred yards, were fringed with feathery bamboos,
the current became actually sluggish, and trackers were
sent on shore to expedite the descent. The Yung-ning
loses itself peacefully in the Yang-tsze at the district
city of Na-ch’i Hsien, which lies on the right
bank of both rivers. Under the busy market-town of
Lien-ch’ien-tzŭ, which occupies the bend opposite Na-ch’i,
lay a fleet of about fifty salt junks ready to ascend
to Yung-ning Hsien. They were summoning their
crews by beat of gong, when we issued from the river
on the morning of the 12th of June.</p>

<p>I must not leave the Yung-ning River without saying
a few words as to its importance as a trade route.
By it, Western Kuei-chow is supplied with salt from
Ssŭ-ch’uan, principally from the Tzŭ-liu-ching wells,
and it is the main thoroughfare for the distribution of
native cottons, manufactured in Ssŭ-ch’uan from raw
cotton from the Central Provinces of China, required
by Western Kuei-chow and Eastern Yün-nan. Foreign
cottons go as far as Sui Fu, and thence by way of the
Hêng and Nan-kuang Rivers to Northern and Eastern
Yün-nan.</p>

<p>At noon we lay under the walls of Lu Chou, and
soon found a comfortable passenger boat, into which
I forthwith transhipped all my followers, and early
next morning we were off. The swollen waters of the
Yang-tsze carried us swiftly eastward, and, on the afternoon
of the 14th of June, we moored under the southern
wall of Ch’ung-k’ing, after an absence of one hundred
and twenty-four days.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1884, I received instructions from
the Foreign Office to report fully, for the information
of the Director of the Royal Gardens at Kew, on the
subject of Chinese Insect White Wax, and to collect
and transmit specimens illustrative of this remarkable
industry. In China, so much of the marvellous is
always mixed up with fact that, in order to gain trustworthy
information on anything that savours of obscurity,
personal observation is essential. To comply with
my instructions, therefore, I found it necessary to pay a
visit to the centre of this wax culture in the province
of Ssŭ-ch’uan, and I resolved to combine with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
researches the ascent of the Sacred Mount O-mei,
from whose summit the famous Glory of Buddha is to
be seen, and to strike on my way back the highest
navigable point on the Yang-tsze. I was, fortunately,
able to carry out this programme, and the present and
subsequent chapters are devoted to an account of the
journey and its results.</p>

<p>In the two preceding years, I had been able so to
regulate my departure from Ch’ung-k’ing as to enjoy
comparatively cool weather during my journeys, but
the fact that the white wax industry is carried on and
completed during the summer months, compelled me to
delay starting till June. My caravan was much the
same as on previous occasions. Had I so willed, I might
have ascended the Yang-tsze by boat to Sui Fu and its
tributary the Min to Chia-ting, and thus saved myself
much overland toil; but, as every explorer knows, the
thirst for new fields becomes after a time irresistible
and must be satisfied. Boat-travelling would have been
altogether too monotonous and uninteresting. My plan,
briefly, was to make for Ho Chou, a trade centre on the
Chia-ling, which enters the Yang-tsze at Ch’ung-k’ing,
strike west in as direct a line as possible to the Min
River and Chia-ting, go west to Mount O-mei, then
proceed south along the eastern borders of Lolodom to
the Yang-tsze, and return, if possible, by water.</p>

<p>The evening of the 1st of June, which was an excessively
hot day even for Ch’ung-k’ing, saw all our
arrangements completed for a start the following morning.
Overnight, thunder and rain raised some doubts
whether my followers would be willing to proceed until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the weather had settled, and when the rain was still
descending heavily at daylight, my doubts became
almost a certainty. They turned up, however, and
begged for delay; but I succeeded in persuading them,
by a series of rather doubtful arguments, that the
heavens had all but exhausted themselves, and that
the sun would show his face before noon. Unfortunately,
my prognostications did not come true, and by
the time we reached Fu-to’u-kuan we were all drenched.
But a start had been effected, and there was no turning
back.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A FERTILE DISTRICT.</i></div>

<p>At Fu-to’u-kuan the road to Ho Chou leaves the
highway to the capital, and goes north by west through
broken country to avoid the windings of the Chia-ling,
which twists and turns from east to west and west to
east in its hurry to reach the Yang-tsze. In the bottom
lands, on terraced hill-sides, and wherever water could
be retained, paddy was planted out; Indian corn, tall
millet, [<i>Sorghum vulgare</i>], tobacco, melons, ginger, taros
[<i>Arum aquaticum</i>], indigo, beans, and hemp or China
grass were everywhere growing luxuriantly. Amid these
plots were the farm-houses, the homesteads nestling in
clumps of bamboo and fir. Here and there rose a fan-palm
and a banyan, and the wood-oil tree was at home
on rocky ground. Bushes of scrub-oak occupied uncultivated
hill-sides, and plantations of mulberry trees and
orange groves were occasionally to be seen. Coal and
lime were everywhere abundant. Several small streams
flow through this country and swell the Chia-ling.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 4th of June, we stood on
the northern brink of this broken country, to the north-east<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and not far below us stretched a plain, while four
miles to the north rose a thirteen-storied pagoda, which
marks the approach to the city of Ho Chou. On reaching
the pagoda, we found ourselves near the right bank
of the Fu Chiang, one of the chief tributaries of the
Chia-ling. The busy market town of Nan-ching-kai,
which stands on the right bank, seemed to be almost
entirely devoted to cotton-weaving; the click-clack of
the loom was heard in every street through which we
passed to the ferry. Ho Chou occupies low rising
ground just above the junction of the two rivers; to it
come for distribution the rich and varied products of
north-eastern Ssŭ-ch’uan&mdash;salt, silk, safflower, lumber,
rape-oil, tobacco, grass-cloth, vegetables, spirits, and a
whole catalogue of medicines.</p>

<p>A special industry of the city is the manufacture of
a soy, which is famous, not only in Ssŭ-ch’uan, but in
other provinces. Chinese soy, as is well known, is imported
into England in large quantities, and is, I believe,
used in the manufacture of sauces. In China itself
there is amongst foreigners a decided prejudice against
soy, and a fresh arrival is often solemnly assured that
it is made of boiled down cockroaches; yet, to the best
of my information, it contains nothing more deleterious
than the juice of a bean.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE VARNISH TREE.</i></div>

<p>On leaving Ho Chou we were again ferried across
the Fu Chiang, and soon reached the western rim of
the plain. Beyond stretches the same broken hilly
country, where I noticed, besides the trees already mentioned,
the varnish tree&mdash;<i>Rhus vernicifera</i>&mdash;growing
to a height of about twenty feet. To obtain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
varnish, incisions are made in the bark near the foot of
the tree in July and August and slips of bamboo inserted.
As in the case of the poppy, the incisions are
made at night and the sap collected next morning. On
exposure to the air, it quickly assumes a dark brown
and ultimately a jet-black colour, and becomes very
sticky. It is used for a great variety of purposes, and
I may state for the information of those interested in
the subject that pure varnish is an excellent natural
cement. The chief objection to its employment for
this purpose is its black colour; but chemical science
might come to the rescue and make it white or colourless.</p>

<p>In this fertile land every available spot is utilised;
even on the low dykes which divide the paddy fields,
mulberry trees and beans spring up. Great though the
quantity of silk produced in the province of Ssŭ-ch’uan
is, the output might be quadrupled if some means could
be devised for delaying the hatching of the silkworm
eggs. The silk season is over, and the trees are still
laden with leaves. Here I observed an ingenious device
for obtaining young trees from the old; round a promising
branch of a tree a piece of bamboo about a foot
in length, which has previously been divided into two
parts along its length, is tied, and the hollow between
the branch and the interior of the bamboo filled with
mould. In a short time suckers leave the branch and
descend into the mould, and, when they are sufficiently
developed, the branch is cut off and planted, the suckers
forming the roots of the young tree.</p>

<p>The Ssŭ-ch’uanese are essentially a light-hearted
and merry race. I have already mentioned how the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
boatmen on the Upper Yang-tsze give vent to their
feelings in song as they toil upwards through the
gorges. In the paddy fields I frequently noticed as
many as twenty men and boys advancing in line,
nearly knee-deep in mud and water, removing with
their toes the weeds from the roots of the young
shoots, and firming the latter in the ground. A song
with a rousing chorus invariably accompanied the work.</p>

<p>Six miles to the south of T’ung-liang Hsien, the
first district city through which we passed to the west
of Ho Chou, there is a range of hills, about two thousand
feet above the surrounding country, where tea is
grown in considerable quantities. The summits of the
range, in which coal, iron, and lime are all found, were
fringed with firs. On leaving T’ung-liang, which is a
centre of cotton-weaving, we succeeded in accomplishing
a stage of about twenty miles in a burning temperature,
which towards night culminated in a thunder and rain
storm, bringing down the thermometer from 90° F., at
which it stood at 9 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> on the 6th, to 69° F. at noon
the following day. So pitilessly did the rain continue
to descend on the 7th of June, that we had to break
the day’s march at eleven o’clock at the city of Ta-tsu
Hsien, having only covered ten miles. We were
all wet, cold, and dispirited; the only living things that
seemed to be positively enjoying themselves were the
ducks flapping their wings and wagging their tails on
the edges, the bull frogs croaking in the centres, and
the swallows skimming low over the surfaces of the
flooded paddy-fields. To the east of Ta-tsu we crossed,
by a fine stone bridge of five arches, that tributary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the T’o River on which we took boat for a short distance
last year at the city of Jung-ch’ang farther south.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A CHARMING SPOT.</i></div>

<p>A long march of nearly thirty miles from Ta-tsu,
through a beautiful country, brought us on the evening
of the 8th of June to the market-town of Hsing-lung-ch’ang,
on the left bank of the Ching-liu, another tributary
of the T’o. A slight sketch of this splendid country
is applicable to the whole of eastern Ssŭ-ch’uan. On
the slope of a red-soiled hill is a clump of bamboos
bending their feathery heads before the breeze. Creeping
down the bank is the melon with its mottled leaves
and large yellow star-shaped flower; and on the edge
is a framework supporting ripe cucumbers. Beneath is
a plot of taros, with their graceful heart-shaped leaves
lowering their tips to the water which half covers their
stems, while underneath, terrace after terrace of flooded
plots of young paddy, divided by fringes of beans,
stretches into the valley, and miniature foamy cascades
dash from terrace to terrace to join the gurgling brook
below. Frame the picture with tall firs, straight young
water-oaks, low umbrageous wood-oil trees, and the
palm with fan-shaped leaves, and, if the peasantry of
this part of Ssŭ-ch’uan are not content with all this
beauty, we will add a rich and fertile soil, and an
abundant water supply.</p>

<p>At the western end of Hsing-lung-ch’ang a large
stone bridge of seven arches spans the river, here sixty
yards in breadth. Instead of crossing the bridge, we
hired four small boats, and dropped down stream for a
distance of ten miles, where a waterfall, with a drop of
from fifteen to twenty feet, obstructs navigation. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
river teemed with fish, and otter-fishing was in full
swing. The net was circular and fringed with sinkers,
and the fisherman, standing in the bows of the boat,
cast his net with a semicircular sweep, covering a large
surface of water. The net disappeared, the fisherman
holding on to a rope attached to the centre of the net,
where there was also a small circular opening. Drawing
the rope gently until the centre of the net appeared
above the surface, he seized the otter, which was chained
to the boat, and dropped it into the opening. After
allowing the otter a short time to rout out the fish from
the bottom and drive them upwards, net, fish, and otter
were all drawn up together into the boat. The results
were fairly successful.</p>

<p>Two miles south-west of the waterfall we again took
boat, and descended for seven miles between boulders
backed by cliffs full of Man-tzŭ caves. I had already
explored similar caves on the right bank of the Chia-ling
above Ch’ung-k’ing; but my followers, who had
never previously heard of their existence, listened
breathlessly to the boatman, who described them as the
ancient dwelling-places of the aborigines of the country.
These cave-dwellings extend westward to the Min
River, along the banks of which they are particularly
numerous. Landing on the right bank, we proceeded
westward, and soon entered a busy market-town on the
left bank of the T’o River, opposite the important district
city of Nei-chiang Hsien. This city lies on the
high-road from Ch’ung-k’ing to the capital of the province,
but, as last year I made a detour in order to
visit the salt wells of Tzŭ-liu-ching, it did not at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
time come within our ken. Before striking the river,
I noticed a few patches of a plant very much resembling
<i>Abutilon Avicennae</i>, or Ssŭ-ch’uan hemp. There was
this important distinction, however, the stems were
dark brown, almost black. It was locally called <i>T’ung-ma</i>.
Ropes and sacking are manufactured from its
disintegrated bark.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AN EXTENSIVE SUGAR REGION.</i></div>

<p>Nei-chiang, where we rested for a day, is the centre
of an extensive sugar region, and, being in water communication
with the Yang-tsze, it has the great advantage
of being able to distribute its produce speedily and
cheaply. It also exports opium, a little cotton, excellent
grass-cloth, silk, wood-oil, and bean-sauce. To the
west of the T’o, the soil is lighter than to the east, and
there was the necessary adjustment of crops; paddy, of
course, filled the valleys, while sugar-cane, ground-nuts,
tall millet, buckwheat, and sweet potatoes&mdash;<i>Batatas
edulis, Chois</i>&mdash;covered the hill slopes. Tobacco was also
prominent and growing luxuriantly; the tops of the
stems had recently been plucked to cause a greater
development of the large under leaves.</p>

<p>It took us six days to cross from the T’o to the Min;
the country is very similar throughout, the existence of
reservoirs showing, however, that the water supply is
not so good to the west as to the east of the former
river. The crops were the same; but a number of new
trees put in an appearance, including the tallow tree&mdash;<i>Stillingia
sebifera</i>, or <i>Sapium sebiferum, Roxb.</i>, a bushy
thorn some fifteen feet in height&mdash;<i>Cudrania triloba,
Hance</i>, and the wax tree&mdash;<i>Fraxinus Chinensis</i>&mdash;a spe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>cies
of ash. A belt of salt wells extends for some miles
to the east of the left bank of the Min, where the brine
was being raised much in the same way as at Tzŭ-liu-ching.</p>

<p>Two days before reaching the Min, we caught sight
of Mount O-mei towering away to the westward. As
the river is neared, the road winds between stone cliffs
full of ancient cave-dwellings, which are still more
numerous on the left bank of the Min itself. Beautiful
relief carvings adorned the entrances of many of them.
The city of Chia-ting Fu stands on the right bank of
the Min at its junction with the T’ung, which consists
of the waters of the Ya Ho and Ta-tu, both of which
I crossed in their upper reaches last year, and which
unite a little to the west of the city. It is the greatest
centre of sericulture and silk-weaving in the province,
and it marks the eastern boundary of the white wax
industry. I spent the 17th of June among the wax
trees to the north-east of the city; but, finding that I
could conduct my investigations with greater ease and
quietude farther west, I resolved to proceed at once to
the district city of O-mei Hsien, some twenty miles
distant and near to the base of the Sacred Mountain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PILGRIMS TO MOUNT O-MEI.</i></div>

<p>We passed through the west gate of Chia-ting soon
after daybreak of the 18th of June, accompanied by
hundreds of pilgrims of both sexes from all parts of
Ssŭ-ch’uan on their way to visit the sacred shrines of
O-mei. The road follows the left bank of the Ya Ho
till the latter bends southwards, when it crosses a mile
of sand and shingle, and again strikes the river at the
ferry. From the right bank we entered one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
prettiest and most fertile plains in Western China,
watered by streamlets which, rising in the mountains
to the west, go to join the Ya and Ta-tu Rivers, are
easily available for purposes of irrigation, and fill a
perfect network of canals surrounding the plots of land
into which the plain is divided. On the divisions of the
plots rows of wax trees grew thickly. In the city of
O-mei Hsien I spent four days, pursuing my investigations
into the subject of wax culture and the general
trade of the whole district; and at daylight on the
morning of the 23rd, I left with a few of my followers to
ascend the mountain. As it was impossible to obtain
meat in the sacred precincts of Buddha, we purchased
and killed a goat and carried the carcase with us. A
stream of pilgrims, each provided with a bundle of joss-sticks,
candles in baskets, and small pieces of sandalwood
slung in a yellow bag over the shoulder, bore us
company. The mountain lies to the south-west of the
city; and, issuing from the west gate, we proceeded
under the western wall to the south gate, which, at
the time of our visit, was closed against a lengthened
drought. The road then runs south-west over the
plain. Banyans&mdash;some of them of immense size&mdash;lined
the road, and, farther west, wax trees took their place.
Shrines and temples were thickly dotted on both sides,
and at each of these the pilgrims made obeisance, lighted
joss-sticks or candles, and passed on. There was an
impressive solemnity in the worship which I have not
observed elsewhere in China. No levity broke the
living cord of gravity which stretched from shrine to
shrine and temple to temple. The wax trees increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in numbers as we advanced, and the under sides of the
boughs and twigs were here and there silvered with
the wax; they appeared as if a gentle snowstorm had
recently passed over and scattered its flakes on the
branches. But trees and temples were not the only
things that lined the roadway; beggars, mostly women
and girls, were obstinate in their demands for alms, and
no sooner had one gone than another appeared. Mount
O-mei towered above the other ranges that bound the
plain to the south-west, itself the highest point in a
range which descends southwards with giant strides and
blocks the plain. The gray, rocky, rugged, precipitous
face lit up by the morning sun seemed to bid defiance to
the pilgrim, while the lower slopes that hid the giant’s
feet were dark with pine, broken occasionally by bare
patches where cultivation had encroached. Gradually
the plain began to undulate, and we soon entered the
mountains under pine woods, through patches of tall
millet, beans, and Indian corn, and up stone steps&mdash;ladders
would be a more appropriate term&mdash;until at a
distance of nearly twenty miles from the city we reached
Wan-nien-ssŭ&mdash;the “Temple of a Myriad Ages”&mdash;where
we spent the night.</p>

<p>No sooner had we settled down in the fine clean
quarters which the temple affords than the priests came
to pay their respects, and regaled me with the “sweet
tea,” which the discovery of Mr. Baber has rendered
famous. All the way up the mountain side, I had been
making enquiries regarding this tea and its preparation,
but the evidence was decidedly conflicting. Some said
that it was prepared in the ordinary way; others, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the leaves were first steeped in molasses. Although
the infusion was extremely sweet, I must confess that
I failed to detect any flavour of tea. Be it remembered
that the Chinese never take sugar in their tea. The
priests told me that the plant, whence the leaves are
picked, grows in only one gorge in the mountain. The
leaves are large and do not bear the slightest resemblance
to the tea-leaf. I subsequently forwarded a
packet of this “tea” to Hankow to be tasted, and the
reply of an expert came back prompt and concise, “I
never tasted such muck in all my life!” But all doubts
have recently been set at rest, for the plant which provides
the leaves has been identified as the <i>Viburnum
phlebotrichum</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ASCENT OF MOUNT O-MEI.</i></div>

<p>A glance at a map showing the comparative heights
of mountains, will give a good idea of how the top of
the giant has to be reached. Peak rises behind peak,
and each of these has to be surmounted on the way to
the summit. Beyond Wan-nien-ssŭ, which is more
than 3000 feet above the plain, the road is so steep
that no means of conveyance is possible and cultivation
soon ceases. Starting at five o’clock on the morning
of the 24th, we ascended this steep winding ladder and
gained the summit in twelve hours after many a weary
step and many a rest. In fact, had it not been that
British pluck was in the balance, I should have given in
long before. As it was, drenched with perspiration and
mist, I just succeeded in dragging my weary aching
limbs into the temple that crowns the summit, 11,100
feet above the sea.</p>

<p>A few hundred yards above Wan-nien-ssŭ we en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>tered
the clouds, and from that point upward nothing
but impenetrable whiteness was visible. The road, if I
may use the word, ascends through dense pine and
brushwood, and here and there a gulf of whiteness
warned us that we stood on the verge of a precipice.</p>

<p>At the rear of the temple on the “Golden Summit”
is the terrible precipice which is seen from even beyond
the Min. On its very brink once stood a temple of
bronze, which has twice succumbed to lightning shafts
and fire. It was built during the Ming Dynasty, and
rebuilt after its first fall; but on the second occasion
portions of it fell over the precipice, and the only parts
still in their original positions are three small bronze
pagodas, bearing unmistakable traces of fire. Their tops
have been melted and twisted. Beautifully carved
bronze doors, pillars, tiles, and other pieces of what
must have been a magnificent building, lay about in
heaps. It is from the terrace on which the three pagodas
stand that the celebrated “Glory of Buddha” is to
be seen. A low fence of boulders of iron ore prevents
the too anxious sightseer from precipitating himself into
the terrible abyss. If the future traveller should be as
unfortunate as I was, he will stand by this fence with
white clouds overhead and around him, and gaze down
eastwards into impenetrable whiteness, in the vain hope
of seeing the sun burst through the clouds overhead,
and reveal his image on the clouds below. Not once
did this occur during the day of the 25th of June, and
we left the spot in the belief that the “Glory of
Buddha” was not for us. But a single gaze into
this impenetrable white gloom was to me as impressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
as a thousand “Glories of Buddha” could possibly have
been.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PRIESTLY RAPACITY.</i></div>

<p>The pilgrims in their penance&mdash;for it is a penance
to ascend the mountain&mdash;frequently appealed to the
Great Buddha of O-mei as they scrambled up the steep
steps polished by the feet of myriads. On the summit
they paid their devotions to Buddha, lighted their joss-sticks
and candles, prostrated themselves on long stools
covered with palm-coir, threw their incense into the
flames, and gazed to see the “Glory of Buddha.” This
ceremony over, they took from their pockets a few cash
and polished them on the bronze pagodas and doors.
These they carry back to their homes as charms and
souvenirs of their visit to the Golden Summit of O-mei.
The pilgrims come from their native places in groups,
accompanied by one who can read. The latter is the
mouthpiece of his comrades, and recites their prayers to
the Great Buddha.</p>

<p>I have already said that beggars lined the road to
the mountain; but greater and still more importunate
beggars dwell on the mountain side and on the summit.
The priests, smooth-tongued and polite, draw from the
pockets of the pilgrims money to repair the temples
and the road. I did not escape their rapacity. The
appeal was, however, made in such a pleasant way that
it could not be resisted. A few potatoes grown on the
acre which forms the summit were presented to me, and
had to be paid for by a sum much in excess of their
value. The workmanship of the temples, which are
numerous and built of pine from the forests by which
they are surrounded, is often excellent, the artificers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
being the priests themselves. The mountain is credited
as being the home of various kinds of wild animals&mdash;among
them the tiger. Fortunately for us, he did not
put in an appearance, and we saw nothing more deadly
than a couple of large monkeys, one of which had just
leaped from a tree on one side of a chasm to a tree on
the other, while the second was arrested in his pursuit
by our sudden appearance. Medicines of several sorts,
including a species of wild ginseng, were exposed for
sale on the stalls which clung to the mountain side.
As the day of the 26th of June broke as gloomy as its
predecessor, and there was no hope of catching even a
glimpse of the “Glory of Buddha,” I resolved to delay
no longer on the chance of a struggle with the unseen.
The descent was more difficult than the ascent, and I
must confess to three fair falls on the slippery steps,
rendered still more slippery by mist and rain, which
accompanied us half-way down to Wan-nien-ssŭ. Two
hundred yards above the temple, I succeeded in placing
my right foot between two stones forming a step, and
so twisting it that a tendon behind the knee refused to
perform its duty and, with excruciating pain, I managed
to crawl down a hundred yards of precipitous steps,
where a small chair could reach me from below.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 27th we continued the
descent by a different road from that by which we
ascended, previously, however, purchasing a couple of
curiously-carved alpenstocks from the priests, their
makers. A snake in relief twined upwards round the
stock, ending in a head surmounted by a couple of
horns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>The road wound eastward down a gorge between
high precipices, from which numerous cascades leaped
and bounded into a stream flowing eastward, over a
narrow bridge of iron rods spanning the stream near
the end of the gorge, and, after crossing several small
plains, joined the high-road to O-mei Hsien.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHINESE DUPLICITY.</i></div>

<p>On my return to the city, I found that every possible
obstacle was being raised to prevent the completion of
my journey. The magistrate sent his secretary to
inform me that there was no road southwards to the
Yang-tsze, and even those of my own men who had
been left behind were unwilling to proceed. It was
suggested that I should return to Chia-ting, take boat
to a point farther south, and then strike inland. I
thereupon sent in search of a trader, who quickly appeared,
and gave me the names of the different stages
to the next city of Ma-pien T’ing. Arming my writer
with the list, I packed him off post haste to the magistrate
with a demand for a double escort to enable me to
penetrate this unknown country. He at once complied
with my demand. Had I been told, what the magistrate
himself probably did not know, that a desultory
warfare was being waged with the aborigines to the
west near Ma-pien, I should have reconsidered my route,
so as not to embroil responsible officers in case of any
accident to my party; but so palpable was the untruth
told me that I did not hesitate for a moment about
proceeding. The unwillingness of my own men, as I
subsequently learned, was due to the fact that two of
my bearers were struck down by typhoid fever during
my absence; and, on my return, they had to be sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
back to Chia-ting, and thence shipped to Ch’ung-k’ing.
It is well that the future is not revealed to us, for, had
I known then that one human life was to be sacrificed
to the privations of the route, I should at once have
relinquished further exploration, and left to others the
honour of descending the Yang-tsze from its highest
navigable point.</p>

<p>The O-mei plain stretches south and south-east for
some fifteen miles to within a short distance of the left
bank of the Ta-tu River, when it is bounded by a spur
which projects south-east from a low range of hills
which lies to the south and east of the chief O-mei
range. The southern half of the plain was in as high a
state of cultivation as the northern, while the wax tree
was still more thickly grown. On descending to the
river we found it in full flood; junks and rafts were
being hurried along by the current at lightning speed,
and on the right bank trackers were dragging their
craft up river at snail’s pace. The road followed for
two days first the left and then the right bank of the
Ta-tu&mdash;which we crossed at the market-town of Fu-lu-ch’ang&mdash;till,
baulked in its eastern course by hilly
ground to the south of the walled village of Tung-kai-ch’ang,
the river flows northwards under precipitous
rocky heights forming its left bank.</p>

<p>Leaving the Ta-tu at the bend, we struck south over
the mountains to Tz’ŭ-chu-p’ing, which, like every other
town and village, is surrounded by a wall and provided
with a garrison. Great excitement was visible everywhere;
the defences of even the meanest hamlet were
conspicuously displayed; rusty gingalls, mounted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
tripod stands and loaded, were placed within the gates
ready to resist attack. But why all this excitement?
A raid by Lolos&mdash;Man-tzŭ they were called&mdash;was recently
successfully organised and carried out, a village
was burned to the ground, and many of its male inhabitants
carried off into the mountains to the west, to be
utilised as shepherds or to await ransom. What the
Chinese greatly resented, however, was the slaughter
of a harmless blind man. The Lolos had swept him off
with the crowd; but, finding after a time that he was
sightless, they did him to death. “Might it not be
that they mistook his blindness for unwillingness to be
a slave?” “No,” said the Chinese, “the Lolos have
no mercy.”</p>

<p>There must be something very unhealthy about this
part of the country. At the end of the first stage from
O-mei Hsien, two more of my men were struck down
with fever; one of them had to be left behind, the
other determined not to leave us and soon recovered
under repeated doses of quinine. Little did I think
when I was acting the <i>rôle</i> of physician that I was to
be the fifth victim.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PRECAUTIONS AGAINST A SURPRISE.</i></div>

<p>When we left Tz’ŭ-chu-p’ing on the morning of the
1st of July, I observed that my escort had been very
materially strengthened, and that the soldiers, instead
of straggling hither and thither, kept close to our caravan.
Rumours were current that a band of Lolos, some
two hundred strong, were in the immediate hills ready
to raid, but undecided as to their ultimate point of
attack, and extra precautions were taken against our
being made unwilling visitors to Lolodom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Proceeding south-east we crossed a low range, and
dropped into a narrow valley between low rocky heights
clad with brushwood. Beyond the valley, waves of
terraced hills crowned with fir and oak had to be surmounted,
and early in the afternoon we looked down
into a deep narrow gorge, wherein a stream flowing
northwards suddenly turns east. On the north bank,
on the only piece of level ground to be seen, stands
the walled town of Chou-pa-ch’ang, facing precipitous
cliffs on the opposite shore. Most of the houses were
furnished with watch-towers on their roofs, and in these,
round smooth stones from the stream’s shingly bed were
piled to resist attack.</p>

<p>Here very poor quarters were available; my room
was over a tenanted pig-sty, and the floor was full of
holes. I awoke next morning, after a restless night,
burning with fever, and scarcely able to leave my bed.
In this wretched inn I lay five whole days, and had
ample time to ponder over the discomforts which the
traveller, who has been brought up under sanitary laws,
has to endure in this land of dirt. Confinement ultimately
became so irksome and depressing that, although
unable to walk to my chair without assistance, on the
morning of the 7th of July I determined to proceed,
and trust to the invigorating influence of fresh air to
effect a cure.</p>

<p>Chou-pa-ch’ang is the highest navigable point for
small craft on the river which is known on Chinese
maps as the Ching-shui, but is locally called the Ma-pien
River, from the city of that name near its source.
Two rapids to the south of the town obstruct navi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>gation,
except for descending rafts. Crossing a streamlet,
which enters the Ma-pien four miles to the south
of Chou-pa-ch’ang, by a narrow chain bridge, the road
leaves the main river, where it makes an eastern bend
and goes south through broken country fairly wooded
with the mulberry, wood-oil, and tallow trees, and, after
ascending some low heights, descends into a large basin,
at the southern end of which we again struck the left
bank of the river at the town of Ni-tien-ch’ang, with
the usual miserable accommodation. Next morning we
crossed the river, and after two days’ winding west and
south-west along its right bank, reached the departmental
city of Ma-pien T’ing. Our approach had been
announced by one of the escort who had preceded us in
search of an inn, and half the population lined the left
bank, on which the city stands, and blocked the streets
through which we had to pass to our quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GUERILLA WARFARE.</i></div>

<p>A guerilla warfare had been waged with the Lolo
mountaineers some time previous to the date of our
arrival; detachments of fifty soldiers had been repeatedly
sent to carry on the work of extermination, but
had not returned to announce their success. Preparations
were being made to conduct operations on a larger
scale, and fifteen hundred troops were quartered in the
city and its neighbourhood. It was forbidden to kill or
dispose of cattle and live stock generally, except for the
use of the soldiery, and we had considerable difficulty
in procuring supplies of any sort.</p>

<p>My escort was now strengthened by a dozen men,
mostly Hunan braves, armed with swords, to conduct
me in safety to the Yang-tsze. To the south-east of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the city the road enters the mountains, where not a
single Lolo was to be seen; the few houses visible were
in reality forts, built on most inaccessible heights. A
solid square of masonry, ten to twelve feet in height,
with only one opening to serve as a doorway, supported
a storey with windows and frequently a watch-tower.
On this stage there was great trouble about food; rice
could not be had for money, and, when I was partaking
of my frugal breakfast, which I had taken the precaution
to carry with me from Ma-pien, I saw my writer
triumphantly waving in his hand, to the envy of all my
other followers, an egg which he had either purloined
or purchased, and off which he was about to make as
hearty a meal as circumstances would allow.</p>

<p>During the day I was told that we should be able
to buy an ox at Ting-nan-pa, the end of the stage, and
we hurried on to prepare the feast of which we were
all so much in need. On arrival, it was suggested in
answer to our enquiries that an ox might be had some
miles further on; but this was little satisfaction to
hungry men. A Good Samaritan at length came to the
rescue, and sold us, at a fabulous price, a leg of some
animal or other&mdash;to this day I have no idea what it
was&mdash;which made an excellent repast.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A FATIGUING JOURNEY.</i></div>

<p>According to the record of stages which I had procured
in Ma-pien, we were still a three days’ journey
from the Yang-tsze; but so many difficulties were
crowding around us&mdash;no food, and my horse-boy very
sick&mdash;that I determined to make a forced march and
avoid at least one day of misery. When we left Ting-nan-pa
on the morning of the 11th of July, I at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
abandoned my chair, proceeded with my escort on foot,
and, after a brisk walk of four hours, reached the
hamlet which was marked on my list as the end of the
stage. It was a dismal place, and without waiting for
my followers, who were still miles in our rear, I pushed
on to the next stage. I was duly warned that the
road was difficult, but the traveller in this land is
accustomed to prevarication, and invariably finds it
hard to elicit the truth.</p>

<p>For some distance east and south-east, the road was
all that could be desired for a Chinese road, and I was
beginning to chuckle to myself at the exposure of the
imaginary difficulties, when it descended to the right
bank of a stream which we had struck and crossed early
in the morning. Here it was studded with huge boulders,
over which we had literally to crawl. After an
hour of this work, I stopped to allow my men to catch
us up. When they arrived they were bursting with
anger.</p>

<p>Having breakfasted off a couple of boiled Indian
corn cobs, I followed my tactics of the morning and
went ahead with my escort. There is no language
strong enough to describe the road that we had then
to follow; it wound with the right bank of the stream
through a mountain gorge and ultimately descended
into a stony plain, through which we made our way to
the market-town of Chung-tu-ch’ang, the end of the
stage. I arrived, dead beat, at five o’clock in the afternoon,
after a walk of thirty miles over a frightful road
and under a broiling sun. The whole caravan did not
turn up till long after dark; my chair was battered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
torn, and tattered; and my horse and mule were hopelessly
lame. The only thing that saved us from utter
collapse was the knowledge that we were only one short
stage from the left bank of the Yang-tsze, where our
overland journeying would probably be at an end.</p>

<p>With as light hearts as we could muster, on the
morning of the 12th of July we left Chung-tu-ch’ang
and the stream which flows behind it, and struck south-east
and south over high hills. To the north towered
confused mountain ranges, peak rising behind peak,
dark and cloud-capped as we passed. On reaching the
southern edge of an undulating plateau we looked into
a deep ravine, down which flowed the stream; and far
away to the south-east a yellow spot could be made out
at the base of a dark mountain range. “What is that
yellow spot?” I asked the keeper of a solitary inn
shaded by a large banyan, just under the brow of the
plateau. “That is the Chin Chiang,” was the welcome
reply&mdash;the Golden River, the upper waters of the Yang-tsze.
For a long time we sat under that shady banyan,
indulging recklessly in rice-broth to strengthen and
cheer us in our hour of joy. There was no laggard
now; down the steep mountain side we hurried to the
stream, and followed its right bank for four miles to
the town of Man-i-ssŭ, which clings to the steep face
of the left bank of the Golden River, and is about fifty
miles higher than the highest point reached by the
Upper Yang-tsze Expedition in 1861. Here, after a
vain search for suitable night quarters, we engaged
three small boats which were moored under the town,
and dropped down river for a distance of twelve miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to the town of Fu-kuan-ts’un on the right bank and
within the province of Yün-nan.</p>

<p>To my surprise, I found that the Yang-tsze is the
boundary of the provinces of Ssŭ-ch’uan and Yün-nan
to within a short distance of the mouth of the Hêng
River, which enters it opposite the town of An-pien, on
the left bank, sixteen miles west of Sui Fu. Fu-kuan-ts’un
was crowded with agents buying up native opium,
and it was only with the assistance of the local authorities
that I was able to secure a small room in an inn.
At the back, however, I soon discovered an outhouse
which I much preferred to the room, and where I was
removed from the glassy eyes of crowds.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PREPARING TO SHOOT THE RAPIDS.</i></div>

<p>Two courses were now open to me&mdash;to proceed overland
to P’ing-shan Hsien and there take junk to Sui
Fu and Ch’ung-k’ing, or to risk the descent of two
dangerous rapids in a boat from Fu-kuan-ts’un. I decided
to adopt the latter alternative; but, as trade so
far west is insignificant and boats do not attempt the
descent unless heavily laden, I had to wait three days
till sufficient cargo had been collected for the craft
which I had engaged. It was so hot on shore that I
spent the night of the 15th on board, for the double
purpose of catching any stray breeze on the river, and
of being able to start at daylight on the morrow.</p>

<p>Our boat was of considerable length, deeply laden,
and fitted with long sweeps at both ends, weighted
with large stones to balance the outlying portions. At
daylight we shipped a special crew of ten men, including
a pilot, to help us down the rapids. They took
entire possession of the fore part of the boat, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
regular crew, also numbering ten, were relegated to the
stern, to work the sweep and a side spar which four
men kept pumping up and down in front of the sweep.
The pilot was a small wizened man of about sixty, with
grizzled beard and moustache, and a keen piercing eye.
His crew of nine&mdash;all young active fellows&mdash;at first
took to the oars, the bow sweep being fastened to the
deck by a noose. Six men hung on the stern sweep,
and four worked the side spar. The descent was comparatively
easy for twelve miles as far as Shih-ch’i-ch’ang,
a market-town on the Yün-nan side, where we
moored above a rapid, and my followers, with the exception
of my writer, personal servant, and one of the
soldiers who had special instructions never to lose sight
of me, took eager advantage of the skipper’s order to
go on shore. I also landed my horse and mule.</p>

<p>Casting off our moorings, we soon slid into the Chi-kan-shih,
which is a long confused mass of water stretching
across the whole breadth of the river. Currents
rush in all directions, causing waves and whirlpools.
The moment we entered the rapid, the pilot shouted
out the order, “To the bow sweep!” Seven of the
oars were quickly thrown aside, and the seven rowers
with the pilot clung round the sweep. With his left
hand on its butt end, the pilot gave his orders to
the steersmen by means of an old fan which he carried
in his right, for the noise and hissing of the waters
drowned his shrill voice. The difficulty was to keep
the boat’s bows with the stream through the currents
and whirlpools. This we accomplished, shipping only a
little water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A SKILFUL PILOT.</i></div>

<p>From this rapid the river rushes with considerable
force south-east and south, till it is barred in the latter
direction by a mountain whose bare cliffs, which have
successfully resisted the attacks of the current, rise
sheer from the angry waters. Foiled in its southern
onset, it rushes east and at right angles to its former
course, causing the most dangerous of all the rapids&mdash;of
which the boatmen enumerate twenty&mdash;on this
section of the river. It is called the <i>Wan-wan T’an</i>,
or “Winding Rapid,” and well does it deserve the name.
The river rushes swiftly to the cliffs, seemingly bent on
carrying all with it. The confusion caused by the rush,
the sharp bend and the sudden contraction is terrible,
and we were, to all appearances, being swiftly hurried
to destruction. But the eye of the pilot wavered not.
His crew on the bow sweep and his old fan saved us
from the cliffs. Once, however, the steersmen were
slow in obeying an order, when the old man threw his
fan on the deck, and with his clenched right hand
repeatedly struck his left palm. The boat’s stern was
within arm’s length of the cliffs! Our soldier fired a
shot from a horse-pistol as we entered each rapid,
whether in its honour or in its defiance I know not.
The rapids passed, the pilot and his crew left us, and we
re-shipped our men, escort, and animals, and proceeded
to Sui Fu, which we did not reach till dark.</p>

<p>We spent the greater part of the 17th of July in
hiring and inspecting a passenger boat to convey us to
Ch’ung-k’ing, and in the afternoon everything was arranged
for a start next morning. Towards night, word
was brought to me that my horse-boy, who occupied a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
room in the inn immediately underneath my own, and
who, I noticed, left the boat very much exhausted the
previous night, was dangerously ill with dysentery,
brought on by the hardships of the route. I at once
consulted his wishes as to proceeding or remaining to
recruit with one of my servants, who was a relative, to
attend to him. He expressed a desire to proceed, and
I ordered a chair to be in waiting next morning to take
him on board. At two o’clock in the morning I was
roused from my sleep by what appeared to be a shout
in Chinese, “Your horse-boy is dead.” I got up and
lit my candle; but there was neither sound nor movement
anywhere. I went to bed again, and at daybreak
my servant announced the poor man’s death. After the
funeral&mdash;I buried him at Sui Fu&mdash;we embarked, and
before noon of the 21st of July we lay off Ch’ung-k’ing,
glad that our overland struggles were at an end.</p>

<p>Although the substance called Chinese Insect White
Wax has long been known in Europe, it is only within
recent years that the mystery which has surrounded
this remarkable industry has been cleared up. Amongst
Europeans, we find Martini in his <i>Novus Atlas Sinensis</i>&mdash;a
work descriptive of the Chinese Empire, published
in 1655&mdash;mentioning <i>alba cera</i> as a product of the
Hu-kwang provinces, and of the province of Kwangsi.
Again, Gabriel de Magalhaes, in his “Nouvelle Rélation
de la Chine,” published in 1668, states that white wax
is produced in the provinces of Hunan, Hupeh, and
Shantung; while in the “Lettres Edificantes,” published
in 1752, Père Chanseaume has a “Memoire sur
la cire d’arbre,” or tree wax. In the “Comptes Rendus
de l’Académie des Sciences” of 1840, Stanislas Julien<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
adds some notes on tree wax and the insects which
produce it, and quotes from Chinese authors on the
same subject; and in volume XII. of the Pharmaceutical
Journal, published in 1853, there is an article by Daniel
Hanbury entitled “The Insect White Wax of China.”
More recently, Fortune, the two delegates of the Shanghai
General Chamber of Commerce who ascended the
River Yang-tsze into Western China in 1868, Baron
von Richthofen, and Gill, have all alluded to the subject;
and Mr. Baber, while he held the post of Her
Majesty’s Agent in Western China, wrote a special
and very interesting report on Insect White Wax, to
which, as his successor, I had free access. In 1880,
Père Rathouis published at Shanghai a short memoir
on the white wax insect.</p>

<p>As early as 1522, this wax is mentioned in Chinese
books; but at that time the idea seems to have been
prevalent that the insects, by some mysterious process
of metamorphosis, were themselves converted into a
white substance and did not excrete the wax.</p>

<p>Although the province of Ssŭ-ch’uan has always
been recognized as the chief breeding country of the
white wax insect, and the great field for the production
and manufacture of the white wax of commerce, the wax
is found and manufactured in several other provinces,
notably in Kuei-chow, Hu-nan, Fuh-kien, Chê-kiang,
and An-hui, and in reality exists in small quantities
from Chih-li in the north to the island of Hainan in the
south of China.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>INSECT WHITE WAX.</i></div>

<p>In the spring of the year 1884, I received instructions
from the Foreign Office to procure for Sir Joseph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Hooker dried specimens of the foliage and flowers of the
trees on which the insects are propagated and excrete
the wax; specimens of the twigs incrusted with the
wax; samples of the cakes in the form in which the wax
occurs in commerce; and Chinese candles made from
the wax. I was also instructed to obtain, if possible,
information on the whole subject of wax production, in
addition to that furnished in Mr. Baber’s Report. My
report on this interesting subject was published as an
Appendix to a Parliamentary Paper in February, 1885;
but at the time that that Paper was written and despatched
I had not completed my investigations, and,
unfortunately, some further notes which I sent to the
Foreign Office were too late for publication with the
Parliamentary Paper. As, therefore, the information
already made public is but fragmentary, and as there
are some mistakes into which, owing to my distance
from scientific advice, I have fallen, I think it right
that I should take the first opportunity that has offered
since my arrival in England of supplying details and
correcting mistakes.</p>

<p>If we glance at a map of China, we will find that
the upper Yang-tsze, or Golden River as it is there
called, is joined by a river called the Ya-lung or Ta-ch’ung,
a little to the west of the one hundred and
second degree of longitude, and that the united waters
flow south-east below the twenty-sixth degree of latitude,
and again turn north, forming, as it were, a loop
towards the province of Yün-nan. Between these two
rivers flows another smaller river called the An-ning,
which joins the Ya-lung before the latter unites with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the Golden River. The An-ning flows down a valley
called the valley of Chien-ch’ang, the local name of
Ning-yuan Fu, the principal town within the river loop.
This valley, the northern boundary of which is lat.
29° 20′, and southern boundary, lat. 27° 11′, is the great
breeding ground of the white wax insect. In the
valley, which is about 5000 feet above the level of the
sea, and on the hills which bound it, there is one very
prominent tree, called by the Chinese of that region
the <i>Ch’ung shu</i>, or “Insect Tree.” It is known under
different names in the same province of Ssŭ-ch’uan; it
is called the <i>Tung-ching shu</i>, or “Evergreen Tree,” and
the <i>Pao-kê-ts’ao shu</i>, or “Crackling-flea Tree,” from the
sputtering of the wood when burning. It is an ever-green
with leaves springing in pairs from the branches.
They are thick, dark-green, glossy, ovate, and pointed.
In the end of May and beginning of June, the tree
bears clusters of small white flowers, which are succeeded
by fruit of a dark purple colour. From the
specimens of the tree which I forwarded to Kew
Gardens, the authorities there have come to the conclusion
that it is <i>Ligustrum lucidum</i>, or large-leaved
privet.</p>

<p>In the month of March 1883, I passed through the
Chien-chang valley; but, knowing that Mr. Baber had
already furnished a report on the subject of white wax,
I confined myself to a mere cursory examination of the
insect tree. In that month, however, I found attached
to the bark of the boughs and twigs, numerous brown
pea-shaped excrescences. The larger excrescences or
scales were readily detachable, and, when opened, pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>sented
either a whitey-brown pulpy mass, or a crowd
of minute animals like flour, whose movements were
only just perceptible to the naked eye.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE WHITE WAX INSECT.</i></div>

<p>In the months of May and June 1884, when I
was called upon for more detailed information on the
subject, I had the opportunity of examining these scales
and their contents with some minuteness in the neighbourhood
of Ch’ung-k’ing, and also within the jurisdiction
of Chia-ting Fu, the chief wax producing country
in the province of Ssŭ-ch’uan. Ten miles to the east of
Ch’ung-k’ing, I plucked the scales from the trees&mdash;the
<i>Ligustrum lucidum</i>&mdash;and on opening them (they are
very brittle) I found a swarm of brown creatures, crawling
about, each provided with six legs and a pair of
<i>antennae</i>. Each of these moving creatures was a white
wax insect&mdash;the <i>coccus pe-la</i> of Westwood. Many of
the scales also contained either a small white bag or
cocoon covering a pupa, or a perfect imago in the shape
of a small black beetle. This beetle is a species of
<i>Brachytarsus</i>. For this information I am indebted to
Mr. McLachlan, to whom the insects forwarded by me
to Kew were submitted for examination.</p>

<p>If left undisturbed in the broken scale, the beetle,
which, from his ungainly appearance, is called by the
Chinese the <i>niu-êrh</i>, or “buffalo,” will, heedless of the
<i>cocci</i> which begin to crawl outside and inside the scale,
continue to burrow in the inner lining of the scale, which
is apparently his food. The Chinese declare that the
beetle eats his minute companions in the scale, or at
least injures them by the pressure of his comparatively
heavy body; and it is true that the scales from Chien-ch’ang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
in which the beetles are numerous are cheaper
than those in which they are absent. But, although
Chinese entomology is not to be trusted, there is, after
all, a grain of truth in the statement. The genus
<i>brachytarsus</i> is parasitic on <i>coccus</i>, and the grub, not
the imago, is the enemy of the white wax insect. The
Chinese, therefore, are not far wrong when they pay a
lower price for the beetle-infested scales.</p>

<p>When a scale is plucked from the tree, an orifice
where it was attached to the bark is disclosed. By
this orifice the <i>cocci</i> are enabled to escape from the detached
scales. If the scales are not detached, but
remain fixed to the bark, it may be asked, “How are
the <i>cocci</i> to find their way out?” It has been stated
by entomologists that they know not of any species of
the family <i>Coccidae</i> that cannot find their way from
underneath the mother-scale without assistance. This
may also hold good in the present case; but all I contend
for is, that the <i>cocci pe-la</i> take eager advantage of
the opening pierced from inside the scale by the beetle
to escape from their imprisonment. In addition to the
branches with intact scales, which I carried home with
me for examination, I closely observed the scales that
had been left undetached on the <i>ligustrum</i>, and found
only one orifice in each scale&mdash;a circular hole similar in
every respect to the orifice pierced by the beetles in
the scales which I had beside me. At Chia-ting I
examined scales that had been brought from the Chien-ch’ang
valley. They were suspended on the wax trees
and were for the most part empty. They had only
one orifice&mdash;that by which they had been attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the bark of the <i>ligustrum</i>, and by which the <i>cocci</i> had
no doubt escaped. In the very first scale I opened there,
however, I found a solitary beetle.</p>

<p>The Chien-ch’ang valley is the great insect-producing
country; but the insects may be, and are, propagated
elsewhere, as in Chien-wei Hsien to the south
of Chia-ting Fu, and even as far east as Ch’ung-k’ing.
These insects are, however, declared by the Chinese to
be inferior, and they fetch a lower price.</p>

<p>Two hundred miles to the north-east of Chien-ch’ang,
and separated from it by a series of mountain
ranges, is the prefecture of Chia-ting, within which
insect white wax as an article of commerce is produced.
In the end of April, the scales are gathered from the
<i>ligustrum</i> in the Chien-ch’ang valley, and collected for
the most part at the town of Tê-ch’ang, on the right
bank of the An-ning River, which I have already mentioned,
in latitude 27° 24′.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TRANSPORT OF THE INSECTS.</i></div>

<p>To this town porters from Chia-ting annually resort
in great numbers&mdash;in former years they are said to have
numbered as many as ten thousand&mdash;to carry the scales
across the mountains to Chia-ting. The scales are made
up into paper packets, each weighing about sixteen
ounces, and a load usually consists of about sixty
packets. Great care has to be taken in the transit of
the scales. The porters between the Chien-ch’ang
valley and Chia-ting travel only during the night, for,
at the season of transit, the temperature is already
high during the day, and would tend to the rapid development
of the insects and their escape from the
scales. At their resting places, the porters open and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
spread out the packets in cool places. Notwithstanding
all these precautions, however, each packet, on
arrival at Chia-ting, is found to be more than an ounce
lighter than when it started from Chien-ch’ang. In
years of plenty, a pound of scales laid down in Chia-ting
costs about half-a-crown; but in years of scarcity,
such as last year, when only a thousand loads are said
to have reached Chia-ting from Chien-ch’ang, the price
is doubled.</p>

<p>In favourable years, a pound of Chien-ch’ang scales
is calculated to produce from four to five pounds of wax;
in bad years, little more than a pound may be expected,
so that, taken as a whole, white wax culture has in it
a considerable element of risk.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE WHITE WAX TREE.</i></div>

<p>West from the right bank of the Min River, on
which the city of Chia-ting lies, stretches a plain to the
foot of the sacred O-mei range of mountains. This
plain, which runs south to the left bank of the Ta-tu
River, which forms the northern boundary of the Chien-ch’ang
valley farther west, is an immense rice-field, being
well-watered by streams from the western mountains.
Almost every plot of ground on this plain, as well as the
bases of the mountains, are thickly edged with stumps,
varying from three or four to a dozen feet in height,
with numerous sprouts rising from their gnarled heads.
These stumps resemble, at a distance, our own pollard
willows. The leaves spring in pairs from the branches;
they are light green, ovate, pointed, serrated, and deciduous.
In June, 1884, when I visited this part of
the country, some of the trees were bearing bunches
apparently of fruit in small pods; but, as no flowering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
specimens were then procurable, there still exists a little
uncertainty as to this tree. I am informed, however,
that it is, in all probability, the <i>Fraxinus Chinensis</i>, a
species of ash. The tree is known to the Chinese as
the <i>Pai-la shu</i>, or “white wax tree.”</p>

<p>It is to this, the great home of the wax tree, that
the scales are carried from the Chien-ch’ang valley.
On their arrival, about the beginning of May, they are
made up into small packets of from twenty to thirty
scales, which are enclosed in a leaf of the wood-oil tree.
The edges of the leaf are tied together with a rice-straw,
by which the packet is also suspended close under the
branches of the wax tree. A few rough holes are drilled
in the leaf with a blunt needle, so that the insects may
find their way through them to the branches.</p>

<p>On emerging from the scales, the insects creep rapidly
up the branches to the leaves, among which they nestle
for a period of thirteen days. They then descend to
the branches and twigs, on which they take up their
positions, the females, doubtless, to provide for a continuation
of the race by developing scales in which
to deposit their eggs, and the males to excrete the
substance known as white wax. Whether or not the
wax is intended as a protection to the scales, I am not
prepared to say. I have frequently observed, however,
scales far removed from any deposit of white wax, and
it may be asked whether or not it is in these scales at
a distance from the wax that the female beetles, cuckoo-like,
deposit their eggs. The Chinese in Chia-ting
have learned to distinguish the wax-producing from
the non-wax-producing insects. They divide them into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
two classes, called respectively, the <i>la-sha</i>, or “wax
sand,” and the <i>huang-sha</i>, or “brown sand.” The
former, which are of a reddish-white colour, are declared
to be the wax producers, while the latter, which are of
a brownish colour, are said to produce no wax. These
are, without doubt, the males and females respectively.
During the thirteen days after their escape from the
scales, and their future life when studded on the bark,
the insects must derive their nourishment from the sap
of the tree, although to the unaided eye there is no
visible impression on leaves or bark. From the absence
of any such marks, the Chinese declare that the insects
live on dew, and that the wax perspires from their
bodies.</p>

<p>The wax first appears as a white coating on the
under sides of the boughs and twigs, and resembles
very much sulphate of quinine, or a covering of snow.
It gradually spreads over the whole branch, and attains,
after three months, a thickness of about a quarter of
an inch. When the white deposit becomes visible on
the branches, the farmer may be seen going the round
of his trees, carefully belabouring each stump with a
heavy wooden club, in order, as he says, to bring to
ground the <i>la-kou</i>, or “wax dog,” a declared enemy of
the wax insect. This probably refers to the beetle-mother.
This clubbing of the stumps was done during
the heat of the day, when the wax insects are said to
have a firm hold of the bark.</p>

<p>After the lapse of a hundred days from the placing
of the insects on the wax tree, the deposit is complete.
The branches are then lopped off, and as much of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
wax as possible removed by hand. This is placed in an
iron pot of boiling water, and the wax, melting, rises
to the surface, is skimmed off and placed in a round
mould, whence it emerges as the white wax of commerce.
Where it is found impossible to remove the wax by
hand, twigs and branches are thrown into the pot, so
that this wax is darker and inferior. Finally, not
satisfied that all the wax has been collected, the operator
takes the insects, which have meantime sunk to the
bottom of the pot, and placing them in a bag, squeezes
them until they have given up the last drop of their
valuable product. They are then&mdash;an ignominious
ending to their short and industrious career&mdash;thrown
to the pigs!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WAX INSECT METAMORPHOSIS.</i></div>

<p>On the 27th of August, 1884, branches of the
<i>ligustrum</i> coated with wax were brought to me. On
removing the wax I found, close to the bark, a number
of minute brown bags, evidently the male <i>cocci</i> in a
state of metamorphosis. I examined the undisturbed
branches from day to day, and on the 4th September I
observed quite a number of white hair-like substances
rising above the surface of the wax deposit. These
ultimately proved to be the white forked tails of the
male insects forcing their way up from the bark, and
dislodging, as they emerged, small quantities of the
wax. They were now provided with long wings, and,
after tarrying for a time on the branches, flew away.
By the 13th of September they had all disappeared,
leaving visible the tunnels from the bark, upwards, by
which they had escaped.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above remarks that, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
branches of the wax tree are boiled with the wax, the
scales are destroyed, and hence it is necessary to have
recourse annually to the Chien-ch’ang valley for fresh
scales with eggs or insects.</p>

<p>When the branches are lopped off a wax tree, a
period of three years is allowed to elapse before the
scales are suspended under the new branches of the
same tree. Wind and rain are greatly dreaded at the
season of suspending the insects, and the sprouts of one
and two years’ growth are considered too weak to resist
a gale.</p>

<p>So much for the wax insect and its product. I
come now to the subject of the quantity produced, its
value and uses.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of kerosene oil into China,
and its almost universal use in the remotest provinces
of the Empire, the demand for white wax has declined
considerably, and the supply has decreased in a corresponding
ratio. Not many years ago, as I have already
stated, ten thousand porters were required to carry
the scales from the Chien-ch’ang valley to the wax tree
country, and in 1884 we find that a thousand porters
were able to transport the Chien-ch’ang supply. In
many homesteads in Ssŭ-ch’uan, where candles were
formerly the only lights, kerosene has been introduced,
and it is now only when lighting is required outside&mdash;for
there is no public lighting in China worthy of the
name&mdash;that candles are employed by those who find it
necessary to leave their homes after nightfall. I find,
however, from the returns of the Chinese Imperial
Maritime Customs for 1884, that the quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Insect White Wax imported into Shanghai in foreign
vessels from the ports on the Yang-tsze, amounted to
7,628 piculs, or 454 tons, valued at 381,440 taels, or
about £95,000&mdash;say on an average £200 a ton.</p>

<p>The value, like the demand, has also declined. Not
many years ago it was quoted at double the prices
realized at present.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>USES OF INSECT WAX.</i></div>

<p>Various uses are ascribed to this wax; but in Western
China, as far as I have been able to gather, its sole
use is for coating the exteriors of animal and vegetable
tallow candles, and for giving a greater consistency to
these tallows before they are manufactured into candles.
Insect White Wax melts at 160° F., whereas animal
tallow melts at about 95° F. Vegetable and animal
tallow candles are therefore dipped into melted white
wax; a coating is given to them, and prevents them
guttering when lighted. It is also said to be used in
other parts of China as a sizing for paper and cotton
goods, for imparting a gloss to silk, and as a furniture
polish. Chemists are likewise declared to utilize it for
coating their pills; but, being in all probability of more
value than the pills, the coating is removed before the
latter are administered. In the Fuh-kien and Chê-kiang
provinces it is employed to impart a polish to
steatite, or soapstone ornaments, after the carving is
completed.</p>

<p>Such, then, is a brief history of the production,
manufacture, and uses of Chinese Insect White Wax&mdash;a
substance interesting from a biological, as well as
from a commercial, point of view.</p>

<p>I felt very highly honoured by a recent invitation,
which was addressed to me by the Chamber of Commerce
of the great manufacturing city of Manchester,
to speak on the subject of trade with China; but I
confess that I had the greatest diffidence in appearing
before a commercial audience, before men who make
trade the business of their lives. A residence of ten
years in a country like China does not necessarily imply
an acquaintance with its trade, and, were this the only
qualification that I possessed, I should have hesitated
to accept the invitation. The trade of China, like the
Empire itself, is vast and varied, and to examine and
discuss it in anything like an exhaustive manner would
have occupied far too much time. Instead, therefore,
of speaking of the general trade of China, I drew their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
attention to that part of the country which has of late
attracted considerable notice from its proximity to
Upper Burmah, now incorporated in our Indian Empire.</p>

<p>South-western China was not unfamiliar to the
audience I then addressed, its trade and trading capabilities
having been brought before the principal
Chambers of Commerce in Great Britain by Mr. Colquhoun
and Mr. Hallett, two gentlemen who took great
interest in the subject&mdash;an interest, too, which they
tried to instil into the commercial world. The part of
China, then, of which I spoke embraced Ssŭ-ch’uan,
Yün-nan, and Kuei-chow, and the observations I made
were based on a three years’ residence and recent journeys,
covering some five thousand miles in these three
provinces.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS.</i></div>

<p>It is impossible to arrive at any definite conclusion
regarding the trade of a country without some knowledge
of the geography of that country; it is therefore
necessary, at the outset, to note the physical characteristics
of Western China. The hundred and tenth
degree of longitude divides China Proper into two
almost equal parts. It does more; it divides the level
from the mountainous half. Yün-nan, Kuei-chow, and
Ssŭ-ch’uan, constitute the southern section of the latter
or mountainous half. Let us, then, deal with these
three provinces in the above order.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CONDITION OF YÜNNAN.</i></div>

<p>Yün-nan is bounded on the north by the province
of Ssŭ-ch’uan, on the west by Upper Burmah and the
Shan States, on the south by the Shan States and
Tonquin, and on the east by the provinces of Kwang-si
and Kuei-chow. It is the birth-place of several well-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>known
rivers. On the west are the Ta-ping and
Shweli, tributaries of the Irrawady; the Salwen and
Mekong flow through its whole length; the Song-koi,
or Red River, and the Hsi Chiang, or West River,
take their rise in the south and east of the province
respectively. The Chin Chiang, or Chin-sha Chiang,
as the upper waters of the Yang-tsze are called, flows
through the north-western corner, and for a considerable
distance divides Yün-nan from Ssŭ-ch’uan. In
the north-east there is one small river, the Ta-kuan,
or Hêng Chiang, a tributary of the Yang-tsze. Of all
these rivers, the only two that are navigable into Yün-nan
are the Song-koi and the Yang-tsze, with its
tributary the Ta-kuan, and these not without some
difficulty.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have two water-routes into Yün-nan,
one in the south and the other in the north. But the
West River is navigated from Canton to Pe-sê, close
to the south-eastern frontier of the province, and is a
very important trade highway to southern and eastern
Yün-nan. In default of a waterway in the west, communication
is kept up by the Bhamo-Ta-li Fu route,
which, being now partly within our Indian Empire, has
attracted no little attention, and raised considerable
expectations for British trade.</p>

<p>It is indeed a pity that these expectations are
doomed to disappointment. The total import and export
trade by this route three years ago did not exceed
half a million sterling. I entered very minutely into
the question of this trade when I visited Ta-li Fu in
1883, and I am thus well acquainted with the area<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
which this route supplies. Ta-Li Fu and Yang-pei
T’ing form its eastern and northern boundary respectively,
and it is from it that the Ta-ping valley draws
its requirements. The country east of Ta-li Fu is supplied
from Yün-nan Fu, the capital of the province,
which again draws both from Canton by the West River,
and from Shanghai by the Yang-tsze. The difficulties of
the Bhamo route are so great that no great improvement
is possible, and no great development of trade
can result. Yün-nan has been described as a rich province.
I have no hesitation in saying that it is; but
it contains a poor population, and, until the condition
of the latter is improved, no great development of
trade need be looked for in that direction. It is estimated
to contain a population of from five to six
millions, the great mass of which is engaged in agricultural
pursuits. True, there are copper mines in the
north and east, and tin and lead mines in the south of
the province; but mining industries are so hampered
by official interference as to profit little the owners or
the workmen. Agriculture, too, is carried on under a
system of small farms, and the absence of good roads
and the impossibility of greatly improving those that
exist, owing to the mountainous character of the province,
do not tend to the enrichment of the peasantry.
Nor is this all; immense tracts in the north and west
of the province have lain waste since the Mohammedan
rebellion, and owing to the antipathy of the Chinese to
settle on lands which they look upon as the property
of people who may still be living, or whose descendants
may still be living, it must be many years before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
agriculture of the province is properly developed. It
will be said that I take a gloomy view of the south-western
corner of China; and I am indeed sorry, for
the sake of our own commerce, that I cannot present a
brighter picture.</p>

<p>I turn now to the province of Kuei-chow, which,
owing to its proximity to the great waterway of China,
is better situated for trade than Yün-nan, but which,
from causes which I shall presently describe, is even
less developed than that province. Kuei-chow has not
inaptly been called the “Switzerland” of China. The
greater part of the province, which is exceedingly
mountainous, was formerly peopled by a non-Chinese
race, called by the Chinese, <i>Miao-tzŭ</i>; but some twenty
years ago a struggle arose between the aboriginal tribes
and the Chinese, in which the latter from their superior
equipment proved victorious, and drove the conquered
into the southern half of the province, although even
in the northern half scattered families may still be
found. The struggle, which lasted for years, was a
desperate one; and, at the present time, traces are
everywhere to be seen in the shape of ruined towns
and villages and lands lying waste and desolate. The
waterways that lead to the province of Kuei-chow, with
one exception, flow through Ssŭ-ch’uan. That exception
is the Yuan River, which, rising in the east of the
province, flows east and north-east into the Tung-t’ing
Lake, which debouches into the Yang-tsze, one hundred
and twenty-three miles to the west of Hankow. This
river, which, although obstructed by numerous rapids,
is navigated to within one hundred and thirty miles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Kuei-yang Fu, the capital of the province, is <i>the</i> trade
highway to Eastern Kuei-chow.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A PROSPEROUS PROVINCE.</i></div>

<p>The trade of the rest of the province is intimately
bound up with that of Ssŭ-ch’uan, through which, owing
to its remaining waterways, it naturally passes. The
population of Kuei-chow is estimated to equal that of
Yün-nan. It consists of immigrants from other neighbouring
provinces, who seem to have left behind them
whatever energy they may have at one time possessed.
Like Yün-nan, Kuei-chow is rich in the variety of its
mineral wealth. Coal, iron, copper, and quicksilver
exist in large quantities; but they are very imperfectly
worked. What it lacks is salt, a necessary which binds
it and its trade to Ssŭ-ch’uan, which is able to supply
not only its own wants, but those of the southern province,
the north of Yün-nan, and parts of other eastern
provinces.</p>

<p>I am happy to be able to pass from these two provinces,
half depopulated by internecine struggles, only
partly cultivated and partly developed, to a brighter
picture. Ssŭ-ch’uan is really a picture of what peace,
contentment, industry, and consequent trade are able
to accomplish. When Yün-nan and Kuei-chow were
convulsed by civil wars, the Ssŭ-ch’uanese were peacefully
journeying up and down the Great River, as the
section of the Yang-tsze in the east of the province is
called, disposing of their surplus produce, and bringing
back not only what they required to satisfy their actual
wants, but also luxuries in the shape of goods of foreign
manufacture. There have been, and still are, skirmishings
in the far west of the province; but rebellions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
have been short-lived, and have little affected the commercial
section which lies to the east of the Min River.
It is of the trade of this province, itself as large as
France, and as populous, that I wish particularly to
draw attention. I shall endeavour to point out the
value of that trade, the conditions under which it is
carried on, and the means that should be taken for its
development.</p>

<p>Although Ssŭ-ch’uan is hilly in the east and centre
and mountainous in the west, cultivation has been
carried to a state bordering on perfection. The dense
population of the province has no doubt largely contributed
to this end; but its fine waterways have
greatly helped the energy of the people. The river
Yang-tsze, which flows through the province, is the
great trunk, having for its northern branches the Min
with its tributaries, the T’o, and the Chia-ling with its
affluents. On the south are the Ta-kuan, the Nan-kuang,
the Yung-ning, the Jên-huai or Ch’ih-shui, the
Ch’i-chiang, and the Kung-t’an Rivers.</p>

<p>On all these rivers there is one constant stream of
traffic, and it will be asked, in what does that traffic
consist? No other province in China can vie with
Ssŭ-ch’uan in the richness and variety of its products,
and I will refer only to those of them which constitute
the chief articles of eastern export. They are, in the
order of their value, opium, silk, salt, sugar, and medicines.
Of these, silk is the only article that reaches
Europe; but, amongst the minor exports, tobacco,
hides, musk, and rhubarb are well-known in this
country. The total value of the export trade of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Ch’ung-k’ing, which is situated on the north bank of
the Yang-tsze, at the mouth of the Chia-ling River,
and is the great trade emporium of the province of
Ssŭ-ch’uan, amounts to more than five million sterling
annually. This must not be assumed to represent the
total value of the surplus produce of the province.
There are several important trade centres that lie
between Ch’ung-k’ing and the western frontier of the
province of Hupeh, such as Fu Chou, Fêng-tu Hsien,
Wan Hsien, and K’uei Fu, each of which contributes
its quota to the large export trade of Ssŭ-ch’uan.
Moreover, the west of the province supplies Tibet
with brick-tea, and the south-western corner, known as
the valley of Chien-ch’ang, sends its silk into Yün-nan
and even into Burmah.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE COTTON TRADE.</i></div>

<p>What, then, does Ssŭ-ch’uan purchase with these
surplus millions? What does this rich province lack?
The answer is easy. Cotton will not flourish in Ssŭ-ch’uan,
and the greater part of her surplus wealth is
consumed in the purchase of raw cotton, native cottons,
and, what is of great importance to British commerce,
foreign cotton and woollen goods. But what
proportion do these imports bear to each other? Raw
cotton exceeds, while native cottons and foreign piece
goods range, each about one million sterling. I should
state, however, that all this cotton is not consumed in
the province of Ssŭ-ch’uan. The Ssŭ-ch’uanese are a
great manufacturing people, and cottons manufactured
from the imported raw material form an important export
from Ssŭ-ch’uan to Yün-nan and Western Kuei-chow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is the import of foreign goods into Western
China that is of paramount interest to the people of this
country. Let us, then, look back for a period of years
and see how this branch of trade has been conducted.
In the various treaties concluded between this country
and China, it is agreed that goods of British manufacture
may, on payment of the tariff import duty and of a
transit duty, be carried into the interior for sale; but
the transit certificates which were issued to the owners
of the goods on payment of the transit duty were by no
means respected. Not only were these certificates not
respected, but the rules and conditions under which they
were issued differed at each port, and this want of
uniformity proved a great hindrance to the development
of the trade. It was not till 1876 that the transit pass
system was placed upon a solid footing.</p>

<p>In the Agreement of Chefoo concluded in that year,
the following clause occurs:&mdash;“The Chinese Government
agrees that Transit Duty Certificates shall be
framed under one rule at all the ports, no difference
being made in the conditions set forth therein; and
that so far as imports are concerned, the nationality
of the person possessing and carrying these is immaterial.”
This has proved a new epoch for the transit
import trade of China, and I will now point out its
effect on Western China, and on the province of Ssŭ-ch’uan
in particular. Before entering into the details
of this trade, however, I should mention that Ichang,
the nearest port to Ssŭ-ch’uan, was opened to foreign
trade by the Agreement of Chefoo in 1876, and that,
previous to that year, Ssŭ-ch’uan drew its supplies from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Hankow, which is four hundred miles to the east of
Ichang and six hundred miles from Shanghai.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TRADE STATISTICS.</i></div>

<p>In 1875, that is to say, when Ichang was not an
open port, foreign goods to the value of £40,000 were
sent under transit pass from Hankow to Ssŭ-ch’uan;
in 1876, the year in which the Agreement of Chefoo
was signed, they rose in value to £160,000, and in 1877
to £290,000.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1877, Ichang was opened; but,
owing to defective steamer communication between that
port and Hankow, it was not till 1878 that it began to
take its share in the transit trade to Ssŭ-ch’uan. In
that year, it sent up goods of the modest value of
scarcely £4,000, against the still increasing transit trade
of Hankow of the value of nearly £400,000. It was
naturally supposed that the opening of Ichang would
attract a considerable share of the transit trade of Hankow;
but, curiously enough, the transit trade of both
ports with Ssŭ-ch’uan went on concurrently increasing.
In 1879, Hankow sent up £600,000, and Ichang
£50,000, a total of £650,000; in 1880, Hankow sent up
£500,000, and Ichang £250,000, a total of £750,000;
in 1881, Hankow figured for £800,000, and Ichang for
£200,000, a total of one million; in 1882, Hankow
figured for £350,000, and Ichang for £200,000, a total
of £550,000; in 1883, Hankow figured for half a million,
and Ichang for £350,000, a total of £850,000; and
in 1884, Hankow figured for £340,000, and Ichang for
£260,000, or a total of £600,000.</p>

<p>The decline of 1884 was due to several causes, the
chief of which were a local drought and the complica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>tions
with France. The average annual value of the
foreign goods sent under transit pass to Ssŭ-ch’uan for
the five years ended the 31st December, 1884, thus
amounted to £750,000, a sum in striking contrast to
the forty thousand pounds’ worth forwarded to the
same destination in 1875.</p>

<p>The following are the figures for 1885-88:&mdash;1885&mdash;Ichang,
£412,000; Hankow, £491,000. 1886&mdash;Ichang,
£342,000; Hankow, £379,000. 1887&mdash;Ichang,
£465,000; Hankow, £255,000. 1888&mdash;Ichang,
£547,000; Hankow, £250,000.</p>

<p>The enormous increase in trade since 1875 says
much for the transit pass clauses in the Agreement of
Chefoo; but I will endeavour to show that, so far as
Western China is concerned, these transit regulations
are by no means perfect. Everyone is aware of the
conservative character of the Chinese, and of the difficulties
that have to be met in inducing them to leave
an established groove. The groove in the present instance
is the city of Ch’ung-k’ing, where the native
merchants of Shanghai and Hankow have established
agencies, to which their foreign goods are consigned
for sale and distribution throughout the province of
Ssŭ-ch’uan. These goods, having paid the tariff import
duty at Shanghai, are carried to Hankow and
Ichang, whence, on payment of a transit duty equal to
half the tariff import duty, they are conveyed to the
province of Ssŭ-ch’uan. The destination of the goods
must be expressly stated in the transit duty certificate
under which they are carried, and for Ssŭ-ch’uan
that destination is Ch’ung-k’ing, where, as I have said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the mercantile agencies are established. So rooted is
this custom, that goods are frequently carried past
their ultimate destination a distance of more than one
hundred miles, thus necessitating their paying an up-freight
to Ch’ung-k’ing and a down-freight to their
destination, and, owing to their being no longer
covered by a transit duty certificate, the usual local
taxation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GRINDING TAXATION.</i></div>

<p>Foreign goods, therefore, when landed at Ch’ung-k’ing,
have paid an import duty and a transit duty,
and, immediately they leave the duty-free area in the
hands of the country buyers, they are liable to payment
of <i>likin</i> and not unfrequently to additional local taxation.
It will naturally be asked, is there no remedy
for this grinding taxation, which seriously affects the
development of trade and limits the consumption of
our manufactures? There is a remedy; but before I
touch on it, let us note how the vast trade of Ssŭ-ch’uan,
including the trade in foreign goods, is carried on.</p>

<p>The import and export trade of Ssŭ-ch’uan, with the
exception of the greater part of the export opium trade,
is conducted on the great water highway&mdash;the Yang-tsze.
This river is navigated by steamers for one
thousand miles, as far as Ichang; but west of that port
the total trade, with the above exception, is carried on
by a fleet of native boats, numbering from five to seven
thousand. Few of these native boats or junks have a
carrying capacity exceeding one hundred tons, and it
will be more intelligible to commercial people if I endeavour
to convert this river trade value into tonnage.
It is estimated that, on an average, thirty junks arrive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
at or pass Ichang daily from Ssŭ-ch’uan, and that a like
number ascends; and if twelve tons be taken as the
average capacity of these junks&mdash;a low estimate&mdash;it will
be found that over twenty thousand tons of cargo are
monthly carried to and from Ssŭ-ch’uan. The junks
also carry a considerable number of passengers, in
addition to the regular passenger traffic which is conducted
between Ssŭ-ch’uan and the Lower Yang-tsze
in specially-constructed boats. But the conditions
under which the navigation of the four hundred miles
that separate Ichang from Ch’ung-k’ing is carried on
are deserving of special examination.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DIFFICULTIES ATTENDING NAVIGATION.</i></div>

<p>Ichang lies at the eastern end of a series of gorges,
which, with extensive breaks, stretches for a distance of
one hundred miles as far as the city of K’uei-chou Fu.
It is within this hundred miles that native boats encounter
difficulties. These difficulties, which are of two
kinds, vary according to the season and according to the
state of the river. At low water, that is to say, during
the months of December, January, February, and
March, the volume of the Yang-tsze, which owing to the
contraction of the channel is cooped up in the Gorges,
on emerging from them pours into the wider bed of the
river, forming races, and in one place a rapid of considerable
importance.</p>

<p>This rapid lies at the eastern end of the Mi-tsang
Gorge, thirty-three miles from Ichang, and is caused by
a sudden declivity of the bed of the river, in the centre
of which, at very low water, two ridges of rock appear,
leaving a narrow channel between. Besides this narrow
passage, however, there are two channels, one on each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
side, between the central rocks and the banks. Fortunately,
at low water the current in the gorges, where
there is no possible tracking ground, is sluggish, and the
unwieldy native craft are either rowed or sail through
them. When the river is high, that is, during the
remaining eight months of the year, the races and rapid
are altogether obliterated, being covered to a depth of
thirty or more feet. The effect of this rise, on the other
hand, is to strengthen the current in the gorges, against
which the junks, there being no towing path, find it
very difficult to make headway. The section of three
hundred miles of river that lies between the gorges
and Ch’ung-k’ing presents no difficulty to navigation.</p>

<p>The time required to navigate a junk between
Ichang and Ch’ung-k’ing depends upon the state of the
river. In winter, twenty-five to thirty days are usually
required, while at high water, in July for example, six
to eight weeks are considered fair passages. The down
journey occupies from six to twelve days. The time
required, the labour employed, and the risks incurred
in navigating a junk on the Upper Yang-tsze, ensure
very heavy freights. The sum of seventy shillings is
a low estimate for a ton of up-cargo between Ichang
and Ch’ung-k’ing, and I notice in the most recent trade
report from the former place, that ten to twelve shillings
were charged as freight on a bale of piece goods
weighing about a hundredweight and a half. It will
hardly be matter of surprise, therefore, that trade in
British goods is heavily handicapped in the comparatively
wealthy province of Ssŭ-ch’uan, when it is borne
in mind that these goods, before they reach the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of the consumer, have paid an import duty, a transit
duty, a heavy freight, <i>likin</i> taxes, and in many instances
other local exactions.</p>

<p>I come now to the remedy, which, under our existing
treaties and engagements with China, can, so far as
I am able to judge, afford the only relief to British
trade. That remedy is the opening of a port in the
province of Ssŭ-ch’uan, on the same conditions as any
one of the nineteen ports at present open to foreign
trade. This is no new scheme. It has been before the
mercantile world for some years, and it has received
the sanction of the Chinese Government, subject to
a condition which has not attracted the attention it
deserves. I quote from the Agreement of Chefoo:&mdash;“The
British Government will further be free to send
officers to reside at Ch’ung-k’ing to watch the conditions
of British trade in Ssŭ-ch’uan. British merchants
will not be allowed to reside at Ch’ung-k’ing,
or to open establishments or warehouses there so long
as no steamers have access to the port. When steamers
have succeeded in ascending the river so far,
further arrangements can be taken into consideration.”
The opening of Ch’ung-k’ing, therefore, is contingent on
steamers reaching that place; in other words, on the
navigability of the Upper Yang-tsze.</p>

<p>This, then, is the point upon which the question of
the development of British trade with Western China
turns, and it is one on which it would be too much to
expect unanimity. The great majority of those who
have ascended in native boats are of opinion that the
river could be navigated by powerful light-draught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
steamers, and nowhere have I seen an opinion which
declares the passage by steamers as impossible. The
successive British Agents at Ch’ung-k’ing have repeatedly
urged the claims of the Upper Yang-tsze on the
attention of British shipbuilders and merchants; but it
is to be feared that Blue Books are not perused with
that care which they sometimes deserve.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NAVAL REPORT ON THE RAPIDS.</i></div>

<p>There is one opinion, however, which, because it is
the only published nautical opinion, and because it is
somewhat adverse, cannot be passed over without comment.
In 1869, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce
sent two delegates up the Yang-tsze to Ch’ung-k’ing,
to collect information on all points bearing on the trade
of Western China, and two naval officers were, at the
request of the Chamber, deputed by Admiral Keppel,
then Commander-in-chief on the China Station, to
accompany the expedition. These officers ascended to
K’uei-chou Fu, which, as I have already stated, lies at
the western end of the gorge and rapid section, and I
will now quote from the report of Lieutenant Dawson
so far as it concerns this part of the river. He says:&mdash;“Having
made as detailed a survey between the entrance
to the Upper River and Ichang as the nature of
the river demanded, and sufficient examination above
that port to satisfy me as to the navigability or otherwise
of the rapids, I conclude the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>“(1)&mdash;That the river to Ichang is navigable for
steamers of 7 feet draught and powerful steering apparatus,
from the beginning of April to the end of
September, and probably, if native report is to be
believed, for the winter months also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“(2)&mdash;That the rapids and other difficulties of the
River above Ichang, as at present known, are so
numerous as to preclude the possibility of steamers of
any description navigating this part until a thorough
detailed survey is made, and the changes of the river
at the different seasons watched and noted by competent
persons.</p>

<p>“(3)&mdash;That such survey could only be made in the
winter months when the river is at its lowest, and
would, if carried as far as Ch’ung-k’ing, in all probability,
occupy two surveyors for two winters.</p>

<p>“(4)&mdash;To particularise or describe any one rapid
from the month’s changes, under which I saw them,
would be useless, as they are continually altering in
danger, as rocks cover and uncover, and doubtless
what would be a dangerous rapid in summer, would be
dangerless in winter, and <i>vice versâ</i>. In the month of
April, the rapids of Tsing-tan and Shan-tou-pien were
the worst.</p>

<p>“(5)&mdash;As far as my experience on the upper part
of the river above Ichang extended, the depth of
water is not a difficulty to be apprehended at any time
of the year, as the average was seldom less than ten
fathoms. Velocity of current, want of anchoring
ground, and intricacy of navigation, are the difficulties
previously alluded to.”</p>

<p>Since 1869, our knowledge of the upper waters of
the Yang-tsze has very much improved. We know
that the section between Hankow and Ichang is navigable
by steamers all the year round, and we know that
the annual rise of the river is not to increase the diffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>culties
of the rapids, but to obliterate them altogether.
With respect to the current, it no doubt runs stronger
at high water; but, regarding the matter in a practical
light, we may say that, if a large heavily-laden junk
can be tracked against the strongest current by a hundred
men, is it impossible for a full-powered light-draught
steamer to follow in its wake? There is one
advantage, too, which the upper section of the river
has over the lower; its channel never shifts, and, once
navigated by a steamer, there is no chance of its being
lost. It is not too much to say that, during the winter
months, the masters of the steamers running between
Hankow and Ichang have to conduct surveying operations
every trip, and I have found no one more anxious
than these very masters to navigate the river from
Ichang to Ch’ung-k’ing, so confident are they of success.</p>

<p>I pass now to the advantages which the opening of
Ch’ung-k’ing would afford to British trade. Our manufactures
could then be laid down in Ch’ung-k’ing on
payment of the tariff duty, and from that point the
buyers from the chief cities of the province, as well as
from Kuei-chow and Yün-nan, would be able to carry
their purchases under transit pass to their ultimate
destination, on payment of the transit duty only. No
other tax or duty, <i>likin</i> or <i>octroi</i>, would add to the price
which the consumer has to pay, and I have no hesitation
in stating that, under such an improved system, Ssŭ-ch’uan
would soon take a very high place in the markets
of the world as a consumer of British manufactures.
The improvement of communication would cause an
enormous development of the products and industries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the province. I need only mention silk as an example.
There is really no limit to the possible development of
this valuable product. In almost every homestead in
the centre and east of the province, silk-culture is carried
on by the women and children of the family, and
the development of this and other exports, which would
arise from the safer, speedier, and cheaper means of
communication between the Upper and Lower Yang-tsze,
would greatly raise the buying capacity of the
peaceful, industrious, and well-to-do Ssŭ-ch’uanese.</p>

<p>Nor is Ch’ung-k’ing the head of navigation of the
Yang-tsze. The section of the river between Ch’ung-k’ing
and Hsü-chou Fu, usually called Sui Fu, a distance
of two hundred miles, is as suited to steamer navigation
as between K’uei-chou Fu and Ch’ung-k’ing, and it is
by this stretch of the river that the trade of Northern
and Western Kuei-chow and Northern Yün-nan is
conducted. West of Sui Fu the trade on the upper
waters of the Yang-tsze, which I have descended from
a point fifty miles higher than P’ing-shan Hsien&mdash;the
farthest point reached by the Upper Yang-tsze Expedition
in 1861&mdash;is insignificant, and above P’ing-shan
there are several rapids which would present serious
obstacles to a steamer, but the trade is insignificant,
and steamers will never be required to run west of Sui
Fu.</p>

<p>I may state here that, in Western China, coal is
abundant and is found close to the Yang-tsze.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ROUTES TO WESTERN CHINA.</i></div>

<p>I have thus endeavoured to point out the amount
and value of the trade of Western China, the conditions
under which it is carried on, and the means which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
should be taken for its development. I propose now
to show that, so far as Ssŭ-ch’uan, Kuei-chow, and
Northern Yün-nan are concerned, there is no possible
rival to the Yang-tsze route. The fact that there are
half a dozen trade routes to Yün-nan affords a proof of
the inaccessibility of the province. I agree with Mr.
Colquhoun when he says:&mdash;“The configuration of Yün-nan
is such that no single route can reach or ‘tap’ the
whole trade of the province. To propose one route for
the whole country is like advocating some quack
medicine for a patient who lies ill with half a dozen
ailments.” What, then, are we to think of the proposed
route, which is to pass through Yün-nan from
south to north, and “tap” Ssŭ-ch’uan? It is as absurd
as the proposal of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce to
reach Ssŭ-ch’uan from the city of Li-chiang Fu in
North-western Yün-nan. Ssŭ-ch’uan is hemmed in on
the west and south by range after range of mountains,
which will remain formidable barriers to any feasible
trade route until the science of engineering has advanced
far beyond its present stage. Writing of the
Yang-tsze route to Yün-nan, Mr. Colquhoun says:&mdash;“The
Yang-tsze route, there can be no doubt, can only
deal with the northern part of the province. The
physical features of the northern portion of the
country preclude the possibility of trade penetrating
beyond that mountainous and barren region.” I am
sorry that Mr Colquhoun has designated the part of
Yün-nan, which I claim for the Yang-tsze route, barren.
It is exceedingly rich in copper, and contains some of
the most fertile plains in the west of China. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
plains of T’ung-ch’uan and Chao-t’ung are famous.
The admission, however, that Northern Yün-nan will
continue to belong to the Yang-tsze route is important,
because, to reach that part of the country, goods are
carried through the province of Ssŭ-ch’uan. There can
be no question, therefore, as to the trade-route to Ssŭ-ch’uan.
But I need not rest my argument on the
opinions or admissions of others. I have traversed all
the existing trade-routes between Yün-nan and Ssŭ-ch’uan,
and between Yün-nan and Kuei-chow, and I
have very vivid and bitter recollections connected with
them. In proof of the difficulties that exist, I may
state that it is a common occurrence to see pack animals
lying dead on the mountain sides, and this recollection
is all the more deeply impressed on my mind by the
fact that one of my own horses fell a victim to a vain
search after a practicable trade-route.</p>

<p>But, in addition to the physical features of the
country, there is another consideration that binds the
trade of Western China to the River Yang-tsze. I
have already said that the cotton plant does not
flourish in Ssŭ-ch’uan, and that raw cotton and native
cottons are largely imported by the province. Whence
are they imported? From the Central Provinces of
China, through which the Yang-tsze flows.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PROBABLE REDUCTION OF TAXES.</i></div>

<p>The only route to Ssŭ-ch’uan, Kuei-chow, and
Northern Yün-nan, is the Yang-tsze, on whose upper
waters a large trade in foreign goods is even now conducted,
a trade which is capable of enormous development
when the present burdensome taxation is reduced.
The opening of Ch’ung-k’ing by the ascent of a steamer&mdash;an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
event anxiously looked for by the native merchants
of Ssŭ-ch’uan&mdash;will, as I have pointed out,
reduce that taxation, and will enable millions, who at
present look upon foreign goods as articles of luxury,
to become themselves consumers; and I trust the day
is not far distant when the British flag will float over
entrepôts of British manufactures throughout Western
China.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE NON-CHINESE RACES.</i></div>

<p>The very imperfect nature of our knowledge regarding
the non-Chinese races of Western and South-western
China, constitutes the great impediment to their
exact scientific classification. Notwithstanding this,
however, there are certain well-marked distinctions
that cannot fail to attract the eye and the ear of the
traveller. So great a contrast do the Lolos bear to the
Chinese, that not for a single moment can any idea of
affinity be entertained. And the same holds good with
the Miao-tzŭ of Kuei-chow and the Shans of Yün-nan
who, with the Lolos, form the three great distinctive
races of Kuei-chow, Yün-nan, and Ssŭ-ch’uan. With
regard to the Ku-tsung of North-western Yün-nan
and the Sifan of North-western Ssŭ-ch’uan, the former,
from their physique, dress and language, are undoubted
Tibetans, while the latter are in all probability a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
branch of the same stock. The term Man-tzŭ, although
applied by the Ssŭ-ch’uanese to the inhabitants of the
region to the west of Lolodom and often to the Lolos
themselves, is generically used to designate the non-Chinese
races of Western China.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of these races is defective, for the
simple reason that no foreigner has ever paid them a
lengthened visit, which is essential to a thorough grasp
of their ethnological characteristics. Nor is this a matter
for surprise, as the opportunities, which foreigners
possess of visiting these tribes, whose haunts are removed
from beaten tracks, are few and far between;
and those few who have had such opportunities have
been too much occupied with other work to study ethnological
details or acquire a new language.</p>

<p>As recorded in the preceding pages, I passed through
the countries of most of these tribes; but, like others,
I found myself wanting in leisure to cultivate a closer
intimacy with them. I need only appeal to travellers
in Western China as to the facilities afforded for undertaking
such a task. In what does the traveller’s day
usually consist? He gets up at daybreak, hurries on
to the end of the stage, writes up an account of the
day’s journey, endeavours to get something to eat, and
tries to enjoy a few hours’ sleep ere the labours of
another day begin. The miseries of travel, too, breed
a feeling of restlessness and a hankering after something
more comfortable than his present experiences.
But all the comfort the traveller in these regions
may expect, and too frequently gets, is shelter in a
miserable mud hovel without chair or table&mdash;hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
a promising spot in which to commence ethnological
studies.</p>

<p>Nor is this all; given a chair and a table, the next
difficulty is to find the man whose characteristics it is
intended to study. The treatment which these aborigines
receive at the hands of the Chinese, and the contempt
in which they are held by them, have induced a
timidity which is hard to overcome, and they have
often expressed to me their fears that they would get
into trouble through accepting my invitation to visit
me.</p>

<p>In traversing the country between the Ta-tu River
in Western Ssŭ-ch’uan and the north-west frontier of
Yün-nan, I have frequently seen so-called Man-tzŭ suddenly
quit the roadway and conceal themselves in the
bordering brushwood and tall reeds until we had passed.
And even when an interview has with difficulty been
obtained, my visitors were always anxious to get away
as soon as possible, so that the most the traveller can
do is to note down a few of their more common words,
without attempting the analysis of even a few simple
sentences.</p>

<p>A few short vocabularies are all that I was able to
collect during my journeys; but, towards the end of
1884, chance threw in my way an opportunity of entering
more fully into the language of the principal branch
of the aborigines of Kuei-chow, known to the Chinese
as the Hei or Black Miao, or, as they call themselves,
the Phö.</p>

<p>In that year Mr. Broumton, who was then in charge
of the China Inland Mission station at Kuei-yang,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
came to Ch’ung-k’ing bringing with him a man belonging
to this tribe from the south-east of Kuei-chow, and
he was good enough to place the services of this individual
at my disposal. He was fairly well versed in
Chinese, and I endeavoured to learn something of his
language, and, with his assistance, to translate a few of
the easy exercises of Sir Thomas Wade’s Chinese Colloquial
Course into Phö.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SUBJUGATION OF THE PHÖ.</i></div>

<p>I should state that, according to my teacher, there
is no written character, and my aim was to preserve a
specimen of a tongue which must sooner or later become
extinct. Of late years, the authorities of the province
of Kuei-chow have been endeavouring to compel the
Miao-tzŭ to adopt the Chinese dress and learn the
Chinese language. Their efforts, too, are meeting with
considerable success, and it is safe to predict that the
Phö tongue is within a measurable distance of extinction.</p>

<p>About twenty years ago a desperate struggle commenced
between the Chinese and the Phö, the alleged
origin being attempted extortion on the part of the
former. The struggle lasted for five years, and had it
not been, so say the Phö, that the Chinese obtained a
supply of foreign rifles, it would not have ended so
disastrously for the aborigines. In bright clear weather
no advantage was gained by the Chinese; but the Phö
were pressed hard in rainy weather, when they were
unable to keep the powder of their matchlocks dry. In
this connection I may state that the Phö manufacture
their own guns and ammunition&mdash;their powder, which
is of a brown colour, being famous for its strength and
superiority even among the Chinese.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>The result of the struggle was that the Phö were
terribly decimated; and the population of the tribe is
now estimated not to exceed seventy thousand souls.
The Chinese were assisted in the war against the Phö
by the Ka-tou, generally called the Hua, or Coloured
Miao, and so named because they wear fancy-coloured
garments, just as the Phö are called Black Miao because
they affect dark clothes.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the Miao-tzŭ are a race
altogether different from the Chinese. In physique
they are decidedly inferior; in dress, manners, and
customs they stand alone; and their language, although
it contains a considerable number of borrowed Chinese
words, is undoubtedly distinct. The problem that presents
itself to the traveller in Kuei-chow is not the
affinity between the Miao-tzŭ and the Chinese, but the
relationship of the Miao-tzŭ to each other. They are
divided into a number of tribes whose traits are recognized
not only by the Chinese, but even amongst themselves;
and, as I have already observed, one tribe
is prepared to go to war with the other. In physique
they are the same, but in dress they differ. Do
they speak the same language? The following is a
comparative table of the numerals of three different
tribes dwelling in South-east, Central, and North-west
Kuei-chow, respectively:&mdash;</p>

<p>A glance at the above will show that there is a great
resemblance; and, as the difficulty of transcribing the
living sounds is great, I have no hesitation in saying
that a more careful study will evolve a still more marked
resemblance. The transcription of the Phö sounds in
column II. may be taken as fairly accurate, for they
have been repeated and repeated by me in many hundreds
of combinations without leading to a single mistake.
Nor is the comparison limited to the numerals.
I have transcribed hundreds of words of different tribes,
and the resemblance is equally evident.</p>

<p>The conclusion I have arrived at, after careful comparison
and research, is that the Miao-tzŭ tribes of
Kuei-chow are branches of the same stem, speaking
somewhat different dialects of the same language. This
conclusion, I must not omit to mention, is at variance
with the statements of my Phö teacher, who insisted
that the Ka-tou tongue is totally unintelligible to a
Phö; but I am inclined to think that he was more than
anxious to disclaim all affinity with his quondam enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>But there is another proof that they are of the same
stock. At a gathering of the Phö held once a year,
representatives of the other tribes are present and take
part in the proceedings. This gathering, which takes
place at full moon of the third Chinese month, is of a
character altogether different from the annual fair held
during the third month at Ta-li Fu, where many different
races meet. The latter is a market pure and simple,
whereas the former appears to partake of a religious
nature, and to be connected with the coming harvests.</p>

<p>What the religious aspect is, it is difficult to say,
for deep potations would seem to be the order of the
day. The Miao-tzŭ, like the Lolos, are great drinkers,
the wine being a native spirit. Art is not wanting
among them; the women are exceedingly skilful at
embroidery, and the beautiful silver ornaments&mdash;rings,
clasps, bracelets, ear-rings, brooches, and necklaces&mdash;which
they wear on <i>fête</i> days, are highly finished.
Some of the sterner sex also affect one large silver ear-ring
in, if my memory is not at fault, the left ear.</p>

<p>The dress of the Phö male consists of black loose
trousers surmounted by a short jacket with tight
sleeves. The garments of the female are far more
striking. They consist, to begin at the top, of a black
turban, short jacket and kilt reaching almost to the
feet, the wrists and backs of the sleeves and the hem
of the kilt being ornamented with embroidery, usually
with silk. At the gathering in question, music and
dancing are much indulged in.</p>

<p>The musical instruments are manufactured from
bamboos of different sizes, some of them from twelve to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
fifteen feet long, fitted with a mouth-piece, their lower
ends being inserted in a large hollow cylinder (the hollowed
out trunk of a tree), while the upper end of the
longest reed is usually surmounted by a cone made of
the sheath which grows at the joints of large bamboos.
This instrument is called the <i>ki</i>, and from it a loud
booming noise is, owing to the presence of the cylinder,
extracted. The musicians move round in a circle as
they play, followed on the outskirts by the young
women, who dance in a slow, solemn manner. Of course
the ladies, like their Lolo and Shan sisters, do not bind
their feet. They lead altogether a freer life than the
Chinese, both sexes sitting down to meals at the same
table, and entering fully into the conversation even in
the presence of a foreigner.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MUSIC AND DANCING.</i></div>

<p>The language of the Phö, while following to a great
extent the Chinese idiom, exhibits at the same time
considerable divergence. A “cart-before-the-horse”
principle is very marked throughout. An example or
two will suffice to explain my meaning. The Chinese
for “beef” and “mutton” is “niu jou” and “yang
jou”&mdash;that is, “ox-meat” and “sheep-meat.” The
Phö, on the other hand, say “ngi lia” and “ngi li,”
which, literally translated, mean “meat-ox” and
“meat-sheep.” Again, for “good man” the Chinese
say “hao jên,” where “good man” is the subject of the
sentence; the Phö say “nai ghou”&mdash;“man good,” and
“very good man” is “nai ghou kuai,” that is, the adjective
follows the noun and the adverb the adjective.
There are eight tones readily distinguishable, but they
are not so marked as in Chinese, where a false tone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
may lead to endless confusion. I have read over sentence
after sentence to my teacher, carefully avoiding
to distinguish tones, and, as a rule, he has interpreted
in Chinese the exact meaning intended to be conveyed.
With these brief remarks I leave the language to the
student of philology. Appended are a few exercises
and a short vocabulary in English and Phö. Those
conversant with Chinese will at once detect the large
admixture of Chinese words, which are for the most
part only slightly modified; but the two most striking
peculiarities of the language are the aspirated <i>l</i> and the
<i>v</i> sound.</p>

4.&mdash;Coarse salt. Fine salt. 5.&mdash;To cook food. To put food

<p>6.&mdash;To eat one’s meals. To drink soup. 7.&mdash;I bought yesterday
300 catties of coal, 50 catties of charcoal, 80 catties of firewood,
four piculs of rice, and two hundred catties of flour.</p>

<p>8.&mdash;Lamp oil is made from the bean. Sweet oil is made from sesame.
Lamp oil costs less than sweet oil. 9.&mdash;<i>Tiao t’u</i> means to
light a fire.</p>

<p>10.&mdash;When the weather is cold, the consumption of coal and
charcoal is larger.</p>

<p>11.&mdash;In a stove one uses coal. In a chafing dish charcoal. A
chafing dish is for use in a room. One cannot cook food or heat
water with it.</p>

<p>12.&mdash;Food is either raw or cooked. When prepared over a fire it is
cooked. It is raw when it can be eaten in the natural state.</p>

<p>13.&mdash;You go and buy me a small chicken, and three or four eggs.
Do you want any milk as well? I should like some catties of
milk if it is cheap. In this part of the world we do not buy
milk by the catty, but by the cup or bottle. Fruit is not
bought by the catty either, but by the piece.</p>

<p>14.&mdash;Do you prefer flour or rice? Neither. I like soup. What
soup? Either meat soup or chicken soup suits me.</p>

<p>15.&mdash;Go and get the food ready directly. As soon as it is ready

<h3>WORDS COMBINED.</h3>

<div class="wordscombined">

<p>1.&mdash;To go to the capital. It will do to go straight or go round.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;In reckoning distance, the straight road is the shortest.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;The south. The north. 4.&mdash;A ship.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;To be on board a ship. To cross a river. To go by sea. The
water is deep. The water is shallow. 6.&mdash;An inn. The innkeeper.
7.&mdash;Trouble. Sorrow. To be in trouble. To be resting.</p>

<p>8.&mdash;When you went to the capital last year, where did you live?
At an inn. I have heard it said that the inns outside the
city are some of them not very good to stay at. That is all
as the innkeeper is a good or a bad one. In my opinion, when
one is tired, any inn is good. All you go to it for is to rest
yourself.</p>

<p>9.&mdash;When you go travelling, do you prefer a cart or a ship? That
all depends upon the country. There are no carts in the south,
and travellers all go by water. The vessels used in river-travelling
are small. Sea-going vessels are larger.</p>

<p>10.&mdash;The water in rivers is shallow, not so deep as in the sea.</p>

<p>11.&mdash;In the voyage you made by sea the year before last, you had a
hard time of it, hadn’t you? I had. It blew hard, and the
ship got ashore on the coast of Shan-tung. All of us who
were on board suffered dreadfully.</p>

<p>12.&mdash;Who looks after the messing on board ship? The people of the
ship look after it.</p>

<p>13.&mdash;What costs most, travelling by water or travelling in a cart?
One spends more travelling in a cart. What! Does the fare
of a cart come to more than one’s passage on board a vessel?
The cart costs more, the reason being that the people we hire
our carts of in the north have also their money to make
out of it.</p></div>

<h2>NOTE ON OPIUM CULTIVATION IN CHINA
AND INDIA.</h2>


<p>In Chapter II. I made special reference to the cultivation
of the poppy and to the method of harvesting
opium in Western China; but subsequent personal
observation in the eastern provinces has taught me
that the process, employed in the west, of collecting
the juice is not the only system practised in China.
At Wênchow, in the province of Chêkiang, where the
poppy is extensively grown, a small instrument resembling
a carpenter’s plane takes the place of the
multi-bladed wooden handle, and the workman planes
the skin of the capsule from the top downwards, leaving
a thin shaving adhering to the lower end of the poppy-head.
This is repeated four or five times round the
same capsule at due intervals. A dry cloudy day is
selected for harvesting the drug, for sunshine and rain
are said to be inimical to a good collection. In the
former, the sap will not flow freely, while the latter
dilutes the drug. As soon as the side of the capsule
has been planed, the sap exudes from the exposed
surface&mdash;sometimes so rapidly as to drop down on the
leaves and stem and be lost&mdash;and the collector, provided
with only a hollow bamboo wherewith he roughly
scrapes off the juice, follows close on the heels of the
workman with the plane.</p>

<p>That the system in use in Western China approximates
very nearly to the Indian method will be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
from the following remarks on opium cultivation in
Western Malwa, for which I am indebted to my
brother, Andrew Hosie, C.M., M.D., Army Medical
Staff, Mhow:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Opium cultivation in Western Malwa is carried on
entirely by the subjects of the native princes who rule
in this part of India. The seasons in Malwa are three,
the hot, the rainy, and the cold; the hot prevailing
from the middle of March to the middle of June, the
rainy from the middle of June to the end of September,
and the cold from that onwards to the middle of
March. The average rainfall is about thirty inches,
and the extremes of heat and cold experienced in
Northern India are wanting in this region. The soil
is of the cotton variety, resting on disintegrating trap
rock. It is well watered by numerous small streams,
which ultimately find their way into the Jumna. Along
the banks of these streams, towards the end of the rainy
season, the industrious ryot and his family set about
preparing the fields for the poppy planting. They
are first carefully manured with the village refuse,
ploughed and rolled after a most primitive fashion,
and then divided into rectangular plots about five feet
by four, with a raised border of earth some four inches
high all round. These plots are so arranged as to allow
of their being watered with the greatest facility from
the stream or wells in the immediate vicinity. The
seed having been sown in the plots, the watering commences,
the poppy, like the sugar cane, being one of
the thirstiest of plants. Morning and evening, the
ryot with his bullocks may be seen at the wells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
dragging up the big skins of water, which is run by a
series of gutters into the plots all over the thirsty
fields. This watering is carried out every third day.
The seeds having germinated and reached a few inches
in height, the superfluous plants are carefully weeded
out, leaving ample space for every individual plant
remaining. About the beginning of January they
burst into beautiful red and white flowers, and the
odour of the poppy pervades the land. Towards the
end of February, when the petals begin to fall, and
the capsules are still unripe and filled with milky
juice, the collection of the crop begins. In the evening,
the opium collector goes round and with a sharp knife
scarifies each capsule on one side in three parallel
perpendicular cuts. He is careful that these cuts are
only superficial, for, if they penetrated into the interior
of the capsule, a loss of opium would take place and
the oil-bearing seed be spoiled. Next morning the
collector goes round and collects the tears of opium
which have exuded during the night; these, as he
collects them, he either places in the palm of his hand
or in a small flat dish. The morning collection having
been made, it is placed in an earthenware vessel containing
linseed oil. After this the process of scratching
and collecting is repeated three times on opposite
sides of the same capsule. It takes about a month to
collect the whole crop. Here the ryot’s dealing with
the opium ends; it is conveyed to the opium merchants
at such centres as Indore, the capital of the
Maharajah Holkar, where it is made up for exportation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>“Malwa opium is found in many varieties, the
principal of which are flat circular cakes of about
4 to 8 and 16 ounces in weight, without any external
covering, soft blackish brown, with a heavy odour, and
pungent, bitter taste. Another variety occurs in balls
about 10 ounces in weight, covered with broken poppy
petals, dry, hard, and brittle, and of a reddish colour.
The yield of morphia&mdash;the true test of quality&mdash;varies
from 3 to 8 per cent., a very good percentage, so that
Malwa opium is looked upon in the medical world as
being a very reliable drug.</p>

<p>“After the opium crop has been obtained, the capsules
are collected, crushed, and the seed gathered.
From this a yellowish oil is extracted, much used by
the natives for burning and cooking purposes. The
seeds themselves have no narcotic properties, and enter
into the ingredients of curries, and in some parts a
sort of bread is made from them.</p>

<p>“Opium in its crude form is largely consumed by
the cultivators themselves, but not, as far as I am
aware, to much excess. I have often asked why they
took it, and the answer has invariably been that it
made them feel happy, and that they were only by it
able to do their day’s work.</p>

<p>“Opium has been called the gift of God to man,
and its many uses in alleviating human suffering
justify the expression; but the miserable wrecks of
humanity one sees from its abuse remind one forcibly
how a good may be turned to an evil, a blessing to a
curse.</p>
